* get all ISI abbreviations (https://github.com/jiho/ISI-Bib-Toggle ?) and
  create @STRING variables using the concatenated abbreviations as key
  + script to replace all journal names by their corresponding strings
    (need to take care of stuff like missing colons, case...)

* fix paths in create_html.py (the links in the html-output are broken)

* implement tag-merging, tag-renaming

* implement adding a date to each entry

* implement string expansion/collapse for @string{}'s

* Implement a comparison of equivalence of two bibtex-files
  by passing both through, e.g., bibtex2html and compare the result
  - this can be used to check that the parser works:
    1) pass a valid bibtex-file through bibmanip
    2) run the above test to check the integrity
