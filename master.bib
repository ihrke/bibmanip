                  remarkable scaling property in their bursts of
                  spontaneous activity, referred to as "avalanches"
                  (Beggs and Plenz, 2003, 2004). Such scaling suggests
                  a critical property in the coupling of these
                  circuits. We show that similar scaling laws can
                  arise in a simple model for the growth of neuronal
                  processes. In the model (Van Ooyen and Van Pelt,
                  1994, 1996), the spatial range of the processes
                  extending from each neuron is represented by a
                  circle that grows or shrinks as a function of the
                  average intracellular calcium concentration. Neurons
                  interact when the circles corresponding to their
                  processes intersect, with a strength proportional to
                  the area of overlap.},

  abstract = {By utilizing new information from both clinical and
                  experimental (lesion, electrophysiological, and
                  gene-activation) studies with animals, the anatomy
                  underlying anterograde amnesia has been
                  reformulated.  The distinction between temporal lobe
                  and diencephalic amnesia is of limited value in that
                  a common feature of anterograde amnesia is damage to
                  part of an "extended hippocampal system" comprising
                  the hippocampus, the fornix, the mamillary bodies,
                  and the anterior thalamic nuclei. This view, which
                  can be traced back to Delay and Brion (1969),
                  differs from other recent models in placing critical
                  importance on the efferents from the hippocampus via
                  the fornix to the diencephalon. These are necessary
                  for the encoding and, hence, the effective
                  subsequent recall of episodic memory. An additional
                  feature of this hippocampal-anterior thalamic axis
                  is the presence of projections back from the
                  diencephalon to the temporal cortex and hippocampus
                  that also support episodic memory. In contrast, this
                  hippocampal system is not required for tests of item
                  recognition that primarily tax familiarity
                  judgements. Familiarity judgements reflect an
                  independent process that depends on a distinct
                  system involving the perirhinal cortex of the
                  temporal lobe and the medial dorsal nucleus of the
                  thalamus. In the large majority of amnesic cases
                  both the hippocampal-anterior thalamic and the
                  perirhinal-medial dorsal thalamic systems are
                  compromised, leading to severe deficits in both
                  recall and recognition.},

                  22 children (average age 10.7 yrs) who were hearing
                  impaired, and 21 children (average age 11.5 yrs) who
                  were not hearing impaired. The process of
                  integrating syntactic and semantic information and
                  linguistic context after accessing the mental
                  lexicon was measured through participants' reaction
                  times on a lexical decision task. The experimental
                  stimuli varied in the consistency of the case
                  particles, consistency of the semantic category, and
                  type of verb. A negative priming effect of
                  consistency of the case particles was found in both
                  groups. Both groups of children processed syntactic
                  information, whereas the group who were hearing
                  impaired showed no priming effect for semantic
                  information. In the group who were not hearing
                  impaired, processing of the 3 stimulus factors of
                  syntactic and semantic information was
                  independent. These results suggest that (a) the
                  modularity of syntactic and semantic information
                  processing existed in the group who were not hearing
                  impaired, and (b) semantic processing was different
                  in the group who were hearing impaired, though they
                  could process syntactic information of some case
                  particles as part of a basic processing system.},

                  relaxation).  A time-frequency analysis of
                  non-phase-locked activity in the 7-47 Hz range was
                  performed on movement-centred EEG sweeps using
                  wavelet filters and Gabor transforms. All three
                  movements were accompanied by a decrease in beta
                  activity that began contralaterally about 1.5 s
                  prior to the onset of movement but that extended to
                  both sides near the beginning of the movement. This
                  decrease was followed by a rebound after the end of
                  the movement in the ballistic and negative
                  movements. A decrease was also seen in the alpha
                  band during the three paradigms, which began later
                  (1 s before movement) and lasted longer. An increase
                  in gamma activity was only seen during ballistic and
                  sustained movements, while a decrease in gamma
                  energy was observed during negative movements. It
                  was concluded that changes in the beta band of the
                  EEG before movement are related to the preparation
                  for the movement, but an important afferent
                  component may be present in the later changes. Gamma
                  band activity may be just involved in the execution
                  of the movement, related to muscle contraction.},

                  go/no-go paradigms, in order to investigate their
                  relationship with different components of the motor
                  process.  In the first paradigm (S2-centered), the
                  initial tone (S1) was constant (warning), and the
                  second tone (S2) indicated the subject whether to
                  move or not. In the second paradigm (S1-centered),
                  S1 indicated whether to move or not, while S2 just
                  indicated the timing of the movement. A medial
                  frontal beta energy increase was found in all
                  conditions after the stimulus that forces the
                  subject to decide whether to move or not (S1 or S2
                  depending on the paradigm). In both go conditions, a
                  central alpha and beta energy decrease began after

                  activity and movement-related changes are different
                  in the 'on' and 'off' medication motor states. In
                  the 'off' state a low frequency activity in the
                  alpha-beta range (8-25 Hz) that dominates the
                  spectrum is interrupted during the movement, while
                  in the 'on' state baseline frequencies are higher
                  and a peri-movement gamma increase (70-80 Hz) is
                  usually observed. Similar changes have been
                  described with electrocorticographic recordings over
                  the primary motor cortex but the gamma increase was
                  only present during contralateral movements.  We
                  compared ipsi- and contralateral movement-related
                  changes in STN activity, using a time-frequency
                  analysis of the recordings obtained simultaneously
                  in both STN and the scalp (electroencephalography)
                  during right and left hand movements. The
                  movement-related changes observed in the STN in the
                  'on' and the 'off' states were similar to those
                  described previously in terms of predominant
                  frequency bands, but we found bilateral changes in
                  the STN during movements of either hand. A
                  contralateral earlier start of the beta STN changes
                  was mostly observed when the moving hand
                  corresponded to the less-affected side, irrespective
                  of hand dominance. These results suggest that
                  movement-related activity in the STN has, by and
                  large, a bilateral representation and probably
                  reflects cortical input.},

                  changes over the contralateral motor cortex that
                  begin before the movement, but their significance
                  has not been fully established. We studied
                  non-phase-locked changes in cortical oscillatory
                  activity in a S1-centred double-stimulus go/no go
                  paradigm with random interstimulus
                  interval. METHODS: About 58 reference-free EEG
                  channels were analyzed by means of Gabor transforms
                  in a group of 10 healthy subjects. A 2000 Hz tone
                  (S1go, 84\% probability) indicated the subject to
                  make a brisk wrist extension after a second 2000 Hz
                  tone (S2go). The S1-S2 interval was either 1.5, 3 or
                  4.5 s. A 1000 Hz tone (S1 no go, 16\% probability)
                  indicated the subject not to move (and wait for
                  another S1 tone). RESULTS: A frontal 15 Hz
                  synchronization was observed after S1 in all
                  conditions. No further significant changes were
                  observed in the no go condition. A small pre-S2
                  alpha and beta desynchronization could be observed
                  only in the 3 and 4.5s-interval go conditions, being
                  larger in the latter.  CONCLUSIONS: These results
                  suggest that the predictability of the timing of a
                  movement influences the appearance of the
                  pre-movement oscillatory changes; not only motor
                  planning (the 'go' decision) is necessary, but also
                  an estimation of when to move. SIGNIFICANCE: Our
                  findings provide new insight on the relationship
                  between the decision-making process, movement, and
                  cortical oscillatory activity.},

                  overlapping the earliest part of the N20 wave
                  (high-frequency oscillations, HFOs) can be observed
                  in the somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) of
                  normal subjects after filtering then with a
                  high-pass filter (>500 Hz). These HFOs have been
                  related to interneuronal activity in the primary
                  somatosensory cortex. In patients with cortical
                  myoclonus there is a sensorimotor cortical
                  hyperexcitability, expressed neurophysiologically as
                  high-amplitude waves in the SSEPs (giant
                  SSEPs). There have been contradicting reports in the
                  literature on the changes in the HFOs in these
                  patients. The authors studied HFOs in a group of 20
                  patients with cortical myoclonus of different
                  origins and in a control group by means of
                  time-frequency transforms, comparing the results
                  obtained with the amplitude and latency of the
                  classical SSEP waves. All controls had normal HFOs,
                  with two components. Nine patients had no HFOs, nine
                  patients had low-amplitude and/or delayed HFOs, and
                  the remaining two patients, the only without ataxia,
                  had high-amplitude HFOs with a long latency. These
                  results suggest heterogeneity in the pathophysiology
                  of cortical myoclonus, which might be related to the
                  different systems affected.},

                  task-switching, with reference to the theoretical
                  interpretation of behavioural 'switch-costs',
                  focusing on intrinsically competing pairs of tasks,
                  such as object naming in either of two languages;
                  competing arithmetic operations; and Stroop
                  colour-naming vs word-reading. It is argued that the
                  behavioural costs of switching between competing
                  tasks of this kind result from components of the
                  task-set for the preceding task(s), which can remain
                  primed involuntarily ('task-set inertia'). The
                  second half of the chapter describes some new
                  experiments, designed to test the hypothesis of
                  higher-order priming at the level of task
                  control. Three experiments, using existing
                  task-switching paradigms, confirm the prediction
                  that it is control characteristics of the preceding
                  task (the task FROM which a switch is made) that
                  primarily determine switch-costs between competing
                  tasks, rather than characteristics of the upcoming
                  task.  The results also challenge the assumption
                  that task-set is fully reconfigured on 'non-switch'
                  trials, in current task-switching paradigms.  Two
                  further experiments explore a new experimental
                  procedure, designed to exploit the phenomenon of
                  higher-order priming of task control-states, to
                  investigate properties of task-set.},

                  comprehension responses in a sentence-priming
                  context, participants were exposed to repetitions of
                  items that were identical, related, or unrelated to
                  previous target words after zero, one, or four
                  intervening trials. With consistent contexts, the
                  manipulation of target words affects lexical
                  decision response times, relative to two baselines:
                  first presentation and unrelated words. Any change
                  from an identical target word slowed lexical
                  decisions. This effect was consistent across time
                  (lags).  Changing the target word also affected
                  comprehension. Identical context produced the
                  highest amount of priming. However, comprehension
                  priming in every condition (identical, related, and
                  unrelated) was always positive, given that the same
                  comprehension question was asked at each
                  presentation (Experiment 1a). Experiment 1b was run
                  to determine if the lack of lexical decision priming
                  found for related words in Experiment 1a was based
                  on a violation of the expectation that an identical
                  word would follow. Thus in Experiment 1b, the
                  identical condition was eliminated. The results
                  replicated those in Experiment 1a. An Interactive
                  Activation and Competition (IAC) model was
                  constructed to simulate the lexical decision
                  data. One possible explanation for the lack of
                  related priming was a high decay rate. Another is
                  the decrease in attention given to a prime word
                  presented in a sentence context as opposed to
                  presented alone. Experiment 2 examined the variables
                  that affect comprehension. Participants saw
                  identical or related target words, after lags of
                  zero, one, or four trials, but did not make a
                  lexical decision about them. The comprehension
                  question either remained the same or was changed to
                  a related question. The variable that had the most
                  impact was whether the question was repeated
                  identically or was replaced with another
                  question. Any change from the identical question
                  slowed comprehension; therefore, producing negative
                  priming. Lexical decision and comprehension are very
                  specific.  Any change from the event on which a
                  decision is made (target word or comprehension
                  question) eliminated and facilitation effects of
                  repeating the event identically.},

                  cognitive changes occurring in the early stages of
                  Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT). The question
                  addressed by the present study was whether these
                  deficits are the result of the failure of a general
                  inhibitory mechanism, or whether DAT is associated
                  with selective decreases in a subset of inhibitory
                  processes. For this, a computerized battery of tasks
                  assessing several inhibitory mechanisms was
                  administered to 28 mild DAT patients (mean age 75.8

                  leaving a distractor prime unselected, response time
                  or response accuracy to a subsequent probe may be
                  impeded if the distractor prime and probe are
                  identical, or if they are related to one
                  another. This phenomenon, negative priming (NP), has
                  obvious implications for understanding perceptual
                  selection. However, it is not known whether NP
                  results from other kinds of selection processes. Two
                  experiments (n = 5, n = 15, respectively) were
                  designed to investigate whether NP occurs when
                  primes are selected from working memory rather than
                  from a visual display. In both experiments, the Ss
                  memorized two primes, selected one prime for further
                  processing, and classified the contents of a probe
                  display. Significant NP occurred in both
                  experiments. In the second experiment, however, NP
                  occurred only under easy-selection conditions; the
                  effect was reversed under difficult-selection
                  conditions. The findings indicate a role for NP in
                  memory processing, but contrast with the results
                  from perceptual selection studies showing greater NP
                  under difficult-selection than under easy-selection
                  conditions. The present findings suggest a complex
                  and perhaps strategy-dependent relationship between
                  memory selection difficulty and NP.},

                  repression occurs in the brain. We used functional

                  systems involved in keeping unwanted memories out of

                  exclude irrelevant information and suppress

                  examined the implication that these 2 inhibitory
                  processes operate at consistent levels of efficiency
                  within individuals by examining the correlation
                  between 2 cognitive inhibition effects, negative
                  priming and negative error priming.  Negative
                  priming involves slower response to a probe-trial
                  target that was used as a to-be-ignored distractor
                  on the immediately preceding prime trial. Negative
                  error priming is the phenomenon that errors in a

                  involve the correct answer to the preceding
                  problem. Participants (64 Ss, aged 17-45 yrs)
                  received distractor-target pairs of simple addition
                  problems and were required to produce the target
                  problem sum. Negative priming was observed for prime
                  distractors, whereas negative error priming was
                  observed in connection with previous targets but not
                  distractors. Consistent with the assumptions of
                  these working memory models, the magnitudes of the 2

                  report them in order, they will recall a list with a
                  repeated item less well than a list without a
                  repeated item. The repetition deficit has been
                  documented in the memory literature, where it is
                  known as the Ranschburg effect and, more recently,
                  in the perception literature, where it is known as
                  Repetition blindness. Different kinds of mechanism
                  have been suggested to explain the repetition
                  deficit in the two sets of literature.  The
                  perceptual literature claims that the deficit
                  reflects a perceptual failure that, in turn,
                  reflects capacity limits challenged by a rapid rate
                  of presentation. The memory literature claims that
                  the deficit reflects a post-perceptual failure
                  related to retrieval from memory.  The latter claim
                  has the potential to account for both
                  cases. Proponents of perceptual theory argue that
                  the repetition deficit shown at fast rates of
                  presentation is a new phenomenon and established
                  criteria to distinguish it from the Ranschburg
                  effect. Several of the distinctions have already
                  been challenged in the literature, and I test the
                  remaining distinctions and reject them. I argue that
                  there is no need to distinguish the two repetition
                  deficits. Hence, I conclude that a post-perceptual
                  mechanism accounts for the repetition deficit. My
                  results provide boundary conditions that a
                  successful post-perceptual mechanism must
                  fit. First, the deficit appears under whole-report
                  conditions but not under partial report. Second, the
                  deficit occurs only when there are repetitions
                  across trials as well as within trials. Third, the
                  deficit does not occur when performance on no-repeat
                  control trials is too low. No existing accounts of
                  the repetition deficit fits all of the boundary
                  conditions, including two otherwise promising
                  computational models of memory for serial recall,
                  OSCAR and TODAM. I argue that an existing account of
                  negative priming provides a promising direction for
                  future work.},

                  three-component model of working memory. Over the
                  years, this has been successful in giving an
                  integrated account not only of data from normal
                  adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental
                  and neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number
                  of phenomena that are not readily captured by the
                  original model. These are outlined here and a fourth
                  component to the model, the episodic buffer, is
                  proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system
                  that provides temporary storage of information held
                  in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding
                  information from the subsidiary systems, and from
                  long-term memory, into a unitary episodic
                  representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be
                  the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The
                  revised model differs from the old principally in
                  focussing attention on the processes of integrating
                  information, rather than on the isolation of the
                  subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis
                  for tackling the more complex aspects of executive
                  control in working memory.}},

                  of lifespan (lifespan developmental) psychology. The
                  theoretical analysis integrates evolutionary and
                  ontogenetic perspectives on cultural and human
                  development across several levels of
                  analysis. Specific predictions are advanced dealing
                  with the general architecture of lifespan ontogeny,
                  including its directionality and age-differential
                  allocation of developmental resources into the three
                  major goals of developmental adaptation: growth,
                  maintenance, and regulation of loss. Consistent with
                  this general lifespan architecture, a meta-theory of
                  development is outlined that is based on the
                  orchestrated and adaptive interplay between three
                  processes of behavioral regulation: selection,
                  optimization, and compensation. Finally, these

                  ignored words simultaneously presented in another
                  voice or another location. The 1st experiment
                  demonstrated negative priming. Ignored items are
                  shadowed on the next trial more slowly than controls
                  with no history of being rejected in the
                  experiment. The 2nd experiment showed that the
                  inhibition lasts for only one item after
                  presentation, followed by facilitation 3 and 5 items
                  later. The 3rd experiment showed that the inhibitory

                  are to the same ear as when they are to different

                  of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and
                  waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another
                  mode of activity in systems composed of many
                  nonlinear units interacting locally. For example,
                  avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all
                  propagate in systems organized into a critical state
                  in which event sizes show no characteristic scale
                  and are described by power laws. We hypothesized
                  that a similar mode of activity with complex
                  emergent properties could exist in networks of
                  cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in
                  mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat
                  cortex by recording spontaneous local field
                  potentials continuously using a 60 channel
                  multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation
                  of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is
                  described by equations that govern avalanches. As
                  predicted by theory for a critical branching
                  process, the propagation obeys a power law with an
                  exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching
                  parameter close to the critical value of
                  1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at
                  this value optimizes information transmission in
                  feedforward networks, while preventing runaway
                  network excitation. Our findings suggest that
                  "neuronal avalanches" may be a generic property of
                  cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity
                  that differs profoundly from oscillatory,
                  synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the
                  critical state, the network may satisfy the
                  competing demands of information transmission and
                  network stability.},

  abstract = {A major goal of neuroscience is to elucidate
                  mechanisms of cortical information processing and
                  storage. Previous work from our laboratory (Beggs
                  and Plenz, 2003) revealed that propagation of local
                  field potentials (LFPs) in cortical circuits could
                  be described by the same equations that govern
                  avalanches. Whereas modeling studies suggested that
                  these "neuronal avalanches" were optimal for
                  information transmission, it was not clear what role
                  they could play in information storage. Work from
                  numerous other laboratories has shown that cortical
                  structures can generate reproducible spatiotemporal
                  patterns of activity that could be used as a
                  substrate for memory. Here, we show that although
                  neuronal avalanches lasted only a few milliseconds,
                  their spatiotemporal patterns were also stable and
                  significantly repeatable even many hours later. To
                  investigate these issues, we cultured coronal slices
                  of rat cortex for 4 weeks on 60-channel
                  microelectrode arrays and recorded spontaneous
                  extracellular LFPs continuously for 10 hr. Using
                  correlation-based clustering and a global contrast
                  function, we found that each cortical culture
                  spontaneously produced 4736 +/- 2769 (mean +/- SD)
                  neuronal avalanches per hour that clustered into 30
                  +/- 14 statistically significant families of
                  spatiotemporal patterns. In 10 hr of recording, over
                  98\% of the mutual information shared by these
                  avalanche patterns were retained. Additionally,
                  jittering analysis revealed that the correlations
                  between avalanches were temporally precise to within
                  +/-4 msec. The long-term stability, diversity, and
                  temporal precision of these avalanches indicate that
                  they fulfill many of the requirements expected of a
                  substrate for memory and suggest that they play a
                  central role in both information transmission and
                  storage within cortical networks.},

                  obtained from an identity priming task, where a
                  green target had to be selected against a
                  superimposed red distractor. Several priming
                  conditions were realized in a mix of control (CO),
                  negative priming (NP), and positive priming (PP)
                  trials. PP and NP effects in reaction times (RTs)
                  were significant. ERP results conceptually replicate
                  earlier findings of left-posterior P300 reduction in
                  PP and NP trials compared to CO. This ERP effect may
                  reflect the detection of prime-probe similarity
                  corresponding to the concept of a retrieval cue. A
                  novel finding concerned amplitude increase of the
                  frontal late positive complex (LPC) in the order NP,
                  CO, and PP. NP therefore seemed to induce brain
                  activity related to cognitive control and/or memory
                  processes, with reduced LPC amplitude indicating
                  effortful processing. Overall, retrieval-based
                  explanations of identity NP are supported.},

                  discriminability. The NP effect was smaller in the

  abstract = {Previous research (e.g., MacLeod \& Mathews, 1990)
                  has found that anxious individuals show an
                  attentional bias towards negative information, but
                  evidence for such a bias in depressed individuals is
                  equivocal.  Conversely, there are fairly consistent
                  findings that depressed individuals display a recall
                  bias for negative information, whereas the findings
                  for anxious individuals are mixed. However, task
                  demands from this research may not have allowed
                  anxious and depressed subjects to process
                  information to the same extent. In the present
                  study, 15 clinically depressed, 15 clinically
                  anxious, 16 community control, 17 mildly depressed,
                  19 mildly anxious, and 17 nonclinical control
                  subjects were tested on three attentional (modified
                  dot probe, lexical decision, and negative priming)
                  and two memory (word recall, and word completion)
                  tasks using positive and negative words that were
                  related to anxiety, depression, or a control
                  condition. Clinically anxious and clinically
                  depressed subjects both showed that some types of
                  negative information (e.g., anxiety related) were
                  more accessible than positive, but others were not
                  (e.g., depression related, control). Also,
                  clinically depressed subjects showed a tendency to
                  disproportionately attend to negative information in
                  general, whereas clinically anxious subjects avoided
                  it. However, clinically depressed subjects were
                  found to be slower to process information, and this
                  effect could not be accounted for by motor
                  retardation alone. It was concluded that clinically
                  anxious and clinically depressed individuals
                  recognize and respond to negative information in a
                  similar fashion, except that clinically depressed
                  individuals are slower in general to carry out these
                  processes. The results from the two memory tasks
                  indicated that clinically depressed subjects show a
                  recall advantage for negative
                  information. Clinically anxious subjects showed a
                  similar, but less robust pattern. On all tasks,
                  nonclinical samples showed similar, but less
                  pervasive robust effects as their clinical
                  counterparts. Overall, the results suggest that
                  anxiety and depression are characterized by similar
                  attentional biases, except that depressed
                  individuals are slower processors.  This difference
                  may produce divergent patterns in later cognitive
                  processes (e.g., memory) or their products.},

                  individual differences in cognitive
                  processes. However, almost nothing is known about
                  the psychometric properties of the most frequently
                  used measure of inhibition: the negative priming
                  effect. In this paper, we report on two experiments
                  aimed at evaluating the reliability of four negative
                  priming measures.  The first experiment was
                  conducted on a sample of 36 university students who
                  completed three tasks: an identification task, a
                  localization task and a new task adapted from
                  Navon's paradigm. None of the negative priming
                  measures exhibited sufficient reliability. These
                  results were replicated on a larger sample of 151
                  participants whose ages ranged between 30 and 80
                  years with a negative priming measure being based on
                  the Stroop task. In this second experiment, the
                  negative priming effect again appeared to be
                  unreliable whilst the reliability of an interference

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) was
                  used to identify candidate language processing areas
                  in the intact human brain. Language was defined
                  broadly to include both phonological and
                  lexical-semantic functions and to exclude sensory,
                  motor, and general executive functions.  The
                  language activation task required phonetic and
                  semantic analysis of aurally presented words and was
                  compared with a control task involving perceptual
                  analysis of nonlinguistic sounds. Functional maps of
                  the entire brain were obtained from 30 right-handed
                  subjects. These maps were averaged in standard
                  stereotaxic space to produce a robust "average
                  activation map" that proved reliable in a split-half
                  analysis. As predicted from classical models of
                  language organization based on lesion data, cortical
                  activation associated with language processing was
                  strongly lateralized to the left cerebral hemisphere
                  and involved a network of regions in the frontal,
                  temporal, and parietal lobes.  Less consistent with
                  classical models were (1) the existence of left
                  hemisphere temporoparietal language areas outside
                  the traditional "Wernicke area," namely, in the
                  middle temporal, inferior temporal, fusiform, and
                  angular gyri; (2) extensive left prefrontal language
                  areas outside the classical "Broca area"; and (3)
                  clear participation of these left frontal areas in a
                  task emphasizing "receptive" language
                  functions. Although partly in conflict with the
                  classical model of language localization, these
                  findings are generally compatible with reported
                  lesion data and provide additional support for
                  ongoing efforts to refine and extend the classical
                  model.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis that older adults have more
                  difficulty than younger adults suppressing
                  irrelevant information has been both supported and
                  refuted by past research. The 'gold standard' for
                  measuring inhibitory functioning is the negative
                  priming paradigm. This study examined variables that
                  might help explicate the contradictory findings from
                  past research with this paradigm with the goal of
                  understanding better the age changes in attentional
                  processes. In Experiment 1, 31 young and 31 older
                  adults were tested under three negative priming
                  procedures, considered to require different depths
                  of processing. Older adults did not show inhibition
                  in the low processing procedure but did in the other
                  two procedures while younger adults showed
                  inhibition in all three tasks. The inhibition effect
                  for older adults exceeded that for the young in the
                  task requiring the deepest level of processing.  In
                  Experiment 2, 87 older adults, classified as Low,
                  Mid or High in level of Off-target verbosity,
                  believed to be associated with inhibitory deficits,
                  were tested on the same tasks. As in Experiment 1,
                  older adults did not show an inhibition effect in
                  the low processing procedure but did show an effect
                  in the other two procedures. In addition, the
                  inhibition effect for those in the highest group was
                  greater than for the other groups in the deepest
                  processing task.  In Experiment 3, 50 young adults
                  and 49 older adults were administered a new negative
                  priming procedure. Level of processing was
                  manipulated in two ways. One manipulation resulted
                  in equal inhibition effects for both age groups and
                  the other resulted in a greater effect for older
                  adults than for younger adults. The results from
                  these experiments support the notion that depth of
                  processing is related to the extent to which older
                  adults will show an inhibitory effect and that
                  requiring greater depths of processing may result in
                  excess inhibition as opposed to a reduction in
                  inhibition. Discussions include an attempt to
                  integrate both the inhibition and the episodic
                  retrieval models. Recommendations include a need for
                  a reevaluation of the negative priming paradigm and
                  for examining the association between different
                  brain functions and different inhibitory functions.},

                  a fundamental dimension of information
                  processing. Accounts of sequence learning vary
                  widely, with some authors arguing that parsing and
                  segmentation processes are central, and others
                  proposing that sequence learning involves mere
                  memorization. In this paper, we argue that sequence
                  knowledge is essentially statistical in nature, and
                  that sequence learning involves simple associative
                  prediction mechanisms. We focus on a choice reaction
                  situation introduced by Lee (1997), in which
                  participants were exposed to material that follows a
                  single abstract rule, namely that stimuli are
                  selected randomly, but never appear more than once
                  in a legal sequence. Perhaps surprisingly, people
                  can learn this rule very well. Or can they? We offer
                  a conceptual replication of the original finding,
                  but a very different interpretation of the results,
                  as well as simulation work that makes it clear how
                  highly abstract dimensions of the stimulus material
                  can in fact be learned based on elementary
                  associative mechanisms. We conclude that, when
                  relevant, memory is optimized to facilitate
                  responding to events that have not occurred
                  recently, and that sequence learning in general
                  always involves sensitivity to repetition distance.},

                  processing of distractor information.},

                  retrieve any one of the properties. 15
                  undergraduates were shown famous actors' and TV
                  presenters' faces and were instructed to give their
                  full names as quickly and as accurately as
                  possible. Results showed that, contrary to Burton
                  and Bruce's prediction, knowledge of many
                  descriptive properties facilitated FN latency. An
                  alternative architecture for an interactive

                  represented by a separate pool of lexical output

                  dementia is presented. Her ability to identify
                  objects and faces was investigated, and it was shown
                  that an item's name could sometimes be recalled in
                  the absence of any appropriate semantic
                  information. Performance on multiple-choice tests of
                  semantic knowledge for items that were named was not
                  above chance levels, even though the semantic test
                  immediately followed the naming response. These data
                  appear problematic for current models of face and
                  object processing, where access to a name is
                  dependent upon prior access to information about the
                  identity of the item. However, in the trials where
                  the patient named faces without category
                  information, she appeared to know that the people
                  were celebrities, which suggests that this limited
                  information may allow access to the name and that
                  the degree of semantic access required when naming
                  faces is lower than previously thought.},

                  reported in autism, despite spared negative priming
                  (NP; Bryson, 1995). These findings were explored
                  systematically in two experiments. First, previous
                  findings were extended to determine whether Bryson's
                  null group effects for NP would hold when location-
                  and object-based NP were examined
                  separately. Second, two competing interpretations
                  (motoric vs. attentional) of the RI finding were
                  explored. Experiment I used a spatial localization
                  task in which targets were selected from nontargets
                  on the basis of colour. Results replicated and
                  extended Bryson's report of intact (location-based)
                  NP: The magnitude of location- and colour-based NP
                  effects did not differ significantly between
                  autistic participants and controls matched on
                  baseline reaction time (RT). A trend toward fewer
                  errors and colour-facilitation in the group with
                  autism, however, suggests that participants with
                  autism may process colour information somewhat more
                  automatically than controls. Experiment 2 used a
                  Go-NoGo spatial localization task, in which stimulus
                  location and identity were systematically
                  manipulated. By comparing responses to stimuli that
                  followed Go versus NoGo primes, evidence for a
                  selective excess of location-based
                  Inhibition-of-Return (IOR) in autism
                  emerged. Results support the distinction, made by
                  others, between location- and object-based
                  inhibition, and are consistent with claims that the
                  former may be stronger and/or more basic than the
                  latter. The finding of excessive IOR in autism is
                  discussed with respect to the putative mechanisms
                  underlying this observed inhibitory deficit. Future
                  research directions and clinical applications are

                  identity in autism by examining whether inhibition
                  of spatial location is also spared. The second issue
                  concerns the selectivity of inhibition.  In
                  non-clinical participants inhibition is selectively
                  directed to the properties of the distractor that
                  compete for the control of action; we examined
                  whether individuals with autism also show normal
                  selectivity of inhibition. A negative priming task
                  was used to examine selective spatial inhibition in
                  23 participants with autism, Asperger's disorder, or
                  pervasive developmental disorder (all aged 7-33 yrs)

                  discovered that inhibition of distractor spatial
                  location is within normal limits in autism, as is
                  the ability to selectively direct inhibition to
                  task-relevant stimulus features. In addition, we
                  unexpectedly found that the irrelevant perceptual
                  feature of colour produced a facilitation effect in
                  autism, which has not been observed previously in
                  typical controls. Evidence of colour facilitation
                  implicates more fluent, but presumably less

                  form, color, or a spatial precue was used to direct

                  yrs) participated. In Experiment 1, participants
                  classified tones presented to one ear as wind or
                  string instruments while ignoring tones presented to
                  the other ear.  The task was identical for both the
                  prime and the subsequent probe presentations. Probe
                  reactions were slower for previously ignored tones

  abstract = {Five key topics have been reverberating in
                  hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (EC) research over the
                  past five decades: episodic and semantic memory,
                  path integration ("dead reckoning") and landmark
                  ("map") navigation, and theta oscillation. We
                  suggest that the systematic relations between single
                  cell discharge and the activity of neuronal
                  ensembles reflected in local field theta
                  oscillations provide a useful insight into the
                  relationship among these terms. In rats trained to
                  run in direction-guided (1-dimensional) tasks,
                  hippocampal cell assemblies discharge sequentially,
                  with different assemblies active on opposite runs,
                  i.e., place cells are unidirectional. Such tasks do
                  not require map representation and are formally
                  identical with learning sequentially occurring items
                  in an episode. Hebbian plasticity, acting within the
                  temporal window of the theta cycle, converts the
                  travel distances into synaptic strengths between the
                  sequentially activated and unidirectionally
                  connected assemblies. In contrast, place
                  representations by hippocampal neurons in
                  2-dimensional environments are typically
                  omnidirectional, characteristic of a map. Generation
                  of a map requires exploration, essentially a dead
                  reckoning behavior.  We suggest that omnidirectional
                  navigation through the same places (junctions)
                  during exploration gives rise to omnidirectional
                  place cells and, consequently, maps free of temporal
                  context. Analogously, multiple crossings of common
                  junction(s) of episodes convert the common
                  junction(s) into context-free or semantic
                  memory. Theta oscillation can hence be conceived as
                  the navigation rhythm through both physical and
                  mnemonic space, facilitating the formation of maps
                  and episodic/semantic memories.},

                  categories represent evolutionarily adapted
                  domain-specific knowledge systems that are subserved
                  by distinct neural mechanisms, thereby allowing for
                  their selective impairment in conditions of brain
                  damage. On this view, (some of) the
                  category-specific deficits that have recently been
                  reported in the cognitive neuropsychological
                  literature - for example, the selective damage or
                  sparing of knowledge about animals - are truly
                  categorical effects. Here, we articulate and defend
                  this thesis against the dominant, reductionist
                  theory of category-specific deficits, which holds
                  that the categorical nature of the deficits is the
                  result of selective damage to noncategorically
                  organized visual or functional semantic
                  subsystems. On the latter view, the
                  sensory/functional dimension provides the
                  fundamental organizing principle of the semantic
                  system. Since, according to the latter theory,
                  sensory and functional properties are differentially
                  important in determining the meaning of the members
                  of different semantic categories, selective damage
                  to the visual or the functional semantic subsystem
                  will result in a category-like deficit. A review of
                  the literature and the results of a new case of
                  category-specific deficit will show that the
                  domain-specific knowledge framework provides a
                  better account of category-specific deficits than
                  the sensory/functional dichotomy theory.},

                  (e.g., L. A. Carlson-Radvansky and D. E. Irwin,
                  1994) has suggested that multiple reference frames
                  are simultaneously active before a reference frame
                  is selected. Two experiments involving 42
                  undergraduates examined the on-line selection of a
                  reference frame to determine whether it is assisted
                  by inhibition. These experiments used a
                  negative-priming paradigm in which access to a

                  points. In addition, reference-frame selection seems
                  to be independent of object selection. The authors

  abstract = {While many patients report greater distractibility
                  and emotional distress long after a MHI, studies of
                  mild head injury (MHI) have consistently observed no
                  long-term impairments in memory or attention. Even
                  college students reporting past MHI have recently
                  been shown to report greater emotional distress and
                  forgetfulness in the absence of any memory
                  impairments (Marschark, Richtsmeier, \& Crovitz,
                  1993). However, long-term attentional changes in
                  distractibility have yet to be examined.  Thus, the
                  following studies used a college sample to determine
                  whether small attentional differences in
                  distractibility were associated with past
                  MHI. Furthermore, because MHI appears to
                  differentially impact on the frontal lobes, an area
                  thought to be important in filtering or inhibiting
                  distraction, neuropsychological measures of frontal
                  lobe function were also included. Experiment 1
                  included cognitive (reading with distraction,
                  Stroop) and neuropsychological (Wisconsin Card Sort
                  Test) measures of susceptibility to distraction to
                  explore possible changes associated with past
                  MHI. Other measures assessed attentional shifting
                  ability, general information processing speed in the
                  absence of environmental distraction (modified form
                  of the Controlled Oral Word Association test),
                  working memory (listening span), verbal ability, and
                  non-frontal lobe (spatial) functioning (Benton
                  Judgment of Line Orientation task). These other
                  measures were included to replicate earlier studies
                  observing no MHI-related attentional
                  differences. Experiment 2 further explored whether
                  the selective and small MHI-related increases in
                  distractibility suggested by Experiment 1 (WCST,
                  Stroop cards) may also be observed on other

                  information). In addition, a second non-verbal

                  processes for binding the features together. Binding
                  provides the memorial experience that certain
                  features belong together. The experiments presented
                  here were designed to explicate these as potentially
                  separable sources of age-associated changes in
                  complex memory-namely, to investigate the
                  possibility that age-related changes in memory for
                  complex events arise from deficits in (1) memory for
                  the kinds of information that comprise complex
                  memories, (2) the processes necessary for binding
                  this information into complex memories, or (3) both
                  of these components.  Young and older adults were
                  presented with colored items located within an
                  array. Relative to young adults, older adults had a
                  specific and disproportionate deficit in recognition
                  memory for location, but not for item or for
                  color. Also, older adults consistently demonstrated
                  poorer recognition memory for bound information,
                  especially when all features were acquired
                  intentionally. These feature and binding deficits
                  separately contribute to what have been described as

  abstract = {Two issues were addressed in this study. First, the
                  authors studied the relationship between distractor
                  activation and distractor interference, to see what
                  kind of distractors can produce a larger
                  interference effect on target processing. Second,
                  the effect of prime distractor interference and
                  probe distractor interference on negative priming
                  was examined, to see whether negative priming is
                  contingent on distractor interference. In Experiment
                  1, the authors orthogonally manipulated activation
                  level of prime target and prime distractor to be
                  either high or low. The results indicate that
                  distractor can produce a larger interference effect
                  when it is in the same activation state as the
                  target is. Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 manipulated
                  the activation level of prime target and probe
                  distractor, and confirmed that negative priming
                  manifests only when interference from both prime
                  distractor and probe distractor is high. This study
                  reveals how the interaction between activation level
                  of target and activation level of distractor
                  influences the dynamics of distractor interference,
                  and indicates that interference in both prime trials
                  and probe trials is critical to the manifestation of
                  negative priming. Implications on models of negative
                  priming are discussed.},

  abstract = {This dissertation presents the results of three
                  laboratory experiments conducted to investigate
                  priming phenomena in active memory. The study
                  employs a modification of the standard direct
                  priming method which made it possible to focus the
                  investigation more on conceptual similarities
                  between primes and targets than on their perceptual
                  similarities. The results indicate that phenomena
                  similar to long-term memory priming can be observed
                  in subjects' performance on a task that does not
                  require long-term memory and that can be
                  successfully accomplished by using only one's
                  working memory. In Experiments 1 and 2 positive
                  priming was observed for targets preceded by
                  conceptually identical primes, whereas in Experiment
                  3 negative priming was observed for such items. In
                  the first two experiments subjects were deciding
                  upon responses on the basis of the abstract meaning
                  of a target item, whereas in the last experiment
                  they were using a combination of the meaning of a
                  target item and the location of the corresponding
                  physical stimulus on the screen when deciding on how
                  to respond. Additionally, the study compares two
                  different views on active memory. One view is
                  represented by the hypothesis that active memory is
                  just the activated portion of long-term memory; the
                  second view, by the hypothesis that active memory is
                  a separate and functionally different system than
                  the LTM. The study also compares theoretical
                  implications of various types of models of priming
                  (e.g., spreading-activation and compound-cue models)
                  with the experimental results. It is argued here
                  that the combined results of the three experiments
                  can be best explained by a new model of priming. The
                  model proposed in this dissertation postulates that
                  active memory is a separate processing platform
                  where temporary representations of items are
                  generated and kept available for use by other
                  cognitive processes as manipulative elements. These
                  transient representations are created by combining

                  ganglia are involved in adaptive control of action
                  at both the cognitive and motor levels.  This study
                  examined 'forward planning' in patients with
                  Parkinson's Disease (PD) using scripts as familiar
                  and novel activities, and compared results with
                  Grafman's (1989) model of schematic representation
                  of knowledge and Shallice's (1982) functional
                  model. Five activities ranging in degree of
                  familiarity were studied. Twenty-two non-demented,
                  medically treated, early stage patients with
                  Parkinson's disease, matched for age, IQ, and
                  education normal controls were assessed on five
                  tasks: script generation; importance of action;
                  script fluency; recognition; and word
                  arrangement. Patients with PD scored lower than
                  normal control participants on verbal reasoning,
                  motor function, semantic fluency, but endorsed
                  higher levels of depression. PD patients were also
                  impaired on the frontal behaviours (Apathy, and
                  Executive Dysfunction) and on two prospective memory
                  subscales (Techniques to Remember and Short-Term
                  Habitual) compared to a group of normal
                  participants. In the Script Generation task,
                  participants were asked to generate actions
                  belonging to five different scripts. An effect of
                  script familiarity was observed in the PD group. PD
                  patients generated fewer actions in a novel script
                  compared to normal controls, but they did not differ
                  in the mean generation time. Also patients with
                  Parkinson's disease were impaired in evaluating how
                  important each script event was within the context
                  of goal-oriented activity. In the Script Fluency
                  task, impairment was observed in the PD patients
                  when they were asked to generate words for each
                  activity. Familiarity of the script did not account
                  for this deficit. These results suggest negative
                  priming effects in script fluency. PD patients were
                  as accurate as the normal controls at discriminating
                  between semantically related, target, and
                  semantically unrelated words. These results
                  confirmed that patients with PD have intact
                  immediate recognition memory for scripts. As
                  predicted, PD patients made more sequencing errors
                  in the novel script than did normal control
                  participants. The implications of these findings are
                  discussed in terms of Shallice's functional and
                  Grafman's structural models. The evidence suggests
                  that the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia are
                  differentially involved in planning.  Future
                  directions are suggested.},

                  presented once to each S in a negative priming for

                  were presented using an oscilloscope controlled by a
                  computer system, and the fixation display appeared
                  immediately after a foot pedal was depressed. After
                  500 msec, the prime array was added to the fixation
                  display until the S responded (depressing the key

                  phenomenon that typically occurs when one processes

                  then is presented with the prime distractor as a
                  target on the next trial (probe). The current line
                  of research was initially launched to investigate
                  two hypotheses. One of these is that the various
                  paradigms that are used to investigate negative
                  priming from ignored distractors may not be tapping
                  the same psychological mechanisms.  The second is
                  that it may be possible to isolate a particular
                  paradigm where the negative priming is caused by a
                  selective attention mechanism.  In order to avoid

                  data in the five extra conditions a pattern of
                  performance was derived that can be interpreted as a
                  signature of negative priming.  The pattern uses the
                  six related conditions and does not include the
                  Control condition. There is a general consensus
                  about this signature pattern, called the congruency
                  principle here, among negative priming
                  explanations. The congruency principle states that
                  performance should worsen as the relationship
                  becomes more incongruous (e.g., the distractor and
                  target switch). And, it should improve as the
                  relationship between prime and probe becomes more
                  congruous (e,g., target and distractor both
                  repeat). The findings revealed that three of the
                  most common paradigms for investigating negative
                  priming, location, letter identity, and Stroop,
                  probably have different causes. Furthermore, a
                  biased version of the letter identity paradigm
                  appears to have an attentional cause when measured
                  using a subtraction from a Control condition.  It
                  was further found that, in the unbiased letter
                  identification paradigm, negative priming could be
                  measured using the congruency principle even though
                  it was not present when measured using subtraction
                  from the Control condition. Negative priming is not
                  homogeneous and sometimes it is caused by selective
                  attention. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

  abstract = {Rational choice theory enjoys unprecedented
                  popularity and influence in the behavioral and
                  social sciences, but it generates intractable
                  problems when applied to socially interactive
                  decisions. In individual decisions, instrumental
                  rationality is defined in terms of expected utility
                  maximization. This becomes problematic in
                  interactive decisions, when individuals have only
                  partial control over the outcomes, because expected
                  utility maximization is undefined in the absence of
                  assumptions about how the other participants will
                  behave. Game theory therefore incorporates not only
                  rationality but also common knowledge assumptions,
                  enabling players to anticipate their
                  co-players\&apos; strategies. Under these
                  assumptions, disparate anomalies
                  emerge. Instrumental rationality, conventionally
                  interpreted, fails to explain intuitively obvious
                  features of human interaction, yields predictions
                  starkly at variance with experimental findings, and
                  breaks down completely in certain cases. In
                  particular, focal point selection in pure
                  coordination games is inexplicable, though it is
                  easily achieved in practice; the intuitively
                  compelling payoff-dominance principle lacks rational
                  justification; rationality in social dilemmas is
                  self-defeating; a key solution concept for
                  cooperative coalition games is frequently
                  inapplicable; and rational choice in certain
                  sequential games generates contradictions. In
                  experiments, human players behave more cooperatively
                  and receive higher payoffs than strict rationality
                  would permit. Orthodox conceptions of rationality
                  are evidently internally deficient and inadequate
                  for explaining human interaction. Psychological game
                  theory, based on nonstandard assumptions, is
                  required to solve these problems, and some
                  suggestions along these lines have already been put

                  negative priming. There are two main findings that

                  to decay when RSI is manipulated within-groups but
                  not when RSI is manipulated between-groups. Four
                  experiments are reported that question the
                  reliability of these findings, and subsequently, the
                  validity of episodic retrieval theory. It is argued
                  that in most experimental contexts, the negative
                  priming effect is due to the existence of an
                  inhibitory mechanism in selective attention.},

                  employing a concurrent memory task with a letter

                  large detrimental effect. One possible reason for

                  of inhibitory processes in memory. First, the author
                  examines what constitutes inhibition as it relates
                  to successful performance, negative priming, and
                  neural suppression. Next, generalized inhibitory
                  theories are discussed including evidence relating
                  to the frontal lobe. Problems for generalized
                  inhibitory accounts are then discussed, followed by
                  the role of inhibition in working memory. Inhibition
                  is also explained in terms of a gate-keeper
                  controlling access to the working memory, deleting
                  information and providing restraint.  It is noted
                  that this process is assumed to be impaired in older
                  adults. An alternative to the gatekeeper view is
                  presented in the resource-inhibition model (Engle,
                  Conway, Tuholski, \& Shishler, 1995) asserting that
                  the ability to control attention underlies the
                  ability to suppress goal-relevant
                  information. Dual-inhibition theory, backward
                  inhibition and the effects of inhibition in episodic
                  memory, long term memory, and semantic memory are

                  attended processing of the same stimulus, a
                  phenomenon known as 'negative priming.' Previous
                  research has yielded partial support for the claim
                  that the effect results from the attentional
                  inhibition of central representations, as suggested
                  by the fact that it appears to extend to semantic
                  associates of ignored stimuli. In the current
                  experiment, 60 Ss (undergraduate students)
                  categorized or named pictorial stimuli with
                  superimposed distractor pictures; the effect of
                  unrelated, identical, or categorically related
                  previously ignored pictures was
                  investigated. Furthermore, visual similarity between
                  categorically related picture pairs was manipulated
                  in the naming task. The results indicate negative
                  priming from identical ignored pictures,
                  irrespective of task. However, semantic negative
                  priming was observed in the categorization task
                  only. In the naming task, even visual overlap
                  between categorically related picture pairs failed
                  to induce negative priming. These findings argue

                  words that have been presented repeatedly as
                  targets; novel words do not show NP. The

                  2000-03371-009.)  Negative priming (NP) occurs when
                  responses are slower because the targets were
                  distractors on the preceding trial. Word-naming NP
                  occurs only with words that have been presented
                  repeatedly as targets; novel words do not show
                  NP. The activation-inhibition explanation is that
                  representations of repeated-word distractors are
                  activated already and must be inhibited; the
                  inhibition carries over to the next trial.  If this
                  explanation is correct, novel-word NP should occur
                  if the word is semantically primed (thus activating
                  its representation) before it occurs as a
                  distractor. In two experiments, there was NP for
                  words from a repeated set, and the magnitude of NP
                  increased when the same word could occur as a target
                  on consecutive trials.  There was positive, rather
                  than negative, priming tor novel-word targets that
                  had been semantically primed as distractors. Either
                  the activation from semantic priming was not

  abstract = {Memory for familiar people is essential to
                  understand their identity and guide social
                  interaction. Nevertheless, we know surprisingly
                  little about the structure of such memory. Previous
                  research has assumed that semantic memory for people
                  has a categorical structure, but recently it was
                  proposed that memory for people consists only of
                  associations and lacks any categorical
                  structure. Four experiments are reported that use a
                  novel approach by adapting the 'release from
                  proactive interference' (RPI) methodology for use
                  with lists of famous names. Proactive interference
                  occurs when items presented on successive trials are
                  drawn from the same category. Recall can improve
                  following a change to a different category. Sets of
                  names were selected relating to aspects previously
                  demonstrated, on the basis of reaction time data, to
                  form a category (occupation) and a property
                  (nationality) of celebrities (Johnston \& Bruce,
                  1990). RPI was observed for a change at both levels
                  of representation but was only present without
                  explicitly cueing the change of set when the stimuli
                  differed at the category level. At the property
                  level, RPI was only evident when change of set was
                  explicitly cued. RPI was absent at the set change in
                  a novel, ad hoc distinction suggesting that the
                  effect reflected the underlying memory structure.},

                  patterns were compared in extensive groups of young
                  (N=25) and older (N=38) adults, while they were
                  performing a word stem completion priming
                  task. Based on behavioral findings, we tested the
                  hypothesis that aging affects only the
                  lexical/semantic, but not the perceptual component
                  of word stem priming. To this end, we distinguished
                  between priming-related activity reductions in
                  posterior regions involved in visual processing, and
                  regions associated with lexical/semantic retrieval
                  processes, i.e., left lateral temporal and left
                  prefrontal regions. Both groups revealed significant
                  priming-related response time reductions. However,
                  in accordance with earlier findings, a larger
                  priming effect was found in the group of young
                  participants. In line with previous imaging studies,
                  the groups showed common priming-related activity
                  reductions in the anterior cingulate, and the left
                  inferior prefrontal cortex extending into the
                  anterior portion of the left superior temporal
                  gyrus, and at lower thresholds also in the right
                  occipital lobe.  However, when directly comparing
                  the groups, greater priming-related reductions were
                  found for the young group in the left anterior
                  superior temporal gyrus and the right posterior
                  occipital lobe. These findings suggest that,
                  converse to current psychological views, aging
                  affects both perceptual and lexical/semantic

                  recognize familiar people by visual inspection of
                  their faces. Despite the absence of overt
                  recognition, though, some prosopagnosic patients
                  continue to process the identities of familiar faces
                  covertly. A longstanding controversy concerns
                  whether the recognition deficit in prosopagnosia is
                  specific for faces, or also affects other types of
                  visual stimuli. We investigated whether the patient
                  P.H., who has severe problems with within-class
                  recognition of many types of visual stimuli, would
                  show covert recognition for all stimuli which he
                  cannot recognize overtly. Such a finding would be
                  consistent with the idea that face recognition and
                  recognition of other visually similar stimuli are
                  performed by the same underlying functional
                  mechanisms. We assessed this possibility with a
                  forced-choice decision between correct and incorrect
                  alternative names for familiar faces, cars and
                  flowers, and with comparisons of P.H.'s ability to
                  learn true versus untrue names to familiar faces,
                  cars and flowers. Results indicated that P.H. does
                  show covert recognition of cars and flowers, as well
                  as faces. In addition, the covert effects observed
                  in the forced-choice name decision and learning
                  tasks used here were shown to have a potential
                  common basis. Finally, the possibility of using
                  covert knowledge as a basis for rehabilitation was
                  explored. As was observed by Sergent and Poncet
                  (1990) in their patient, P.H. could achieve some
                  overt face recognition under very specific
                  circumstances.},

  abstract = {We report the results of two experiments that showed
                  that the time needed to respond to a feature of a
                  stimulus increases when that particular feature of
                  that particular stimulus previously had to be
                  ignored. The data of Experiment 2 argue against the
                  hypothesis that the observed stimulus-feature
                  specific negative priming was due to a response
                  conflict instigated by automatic episodic retrieval
                  of prime responses. Experiment 2 also showed that
                  the effects were not caused by difficulties in
                  switching between prime and probe tasks and provided
                  additional evidence for the fact that priming
                  effects were stimulus-feature specific. The present
                  results suggest that the selective inhibition or
                  episodic encoding mechanisms that are assumed to
                  underlie negative priming can operate in a more
                  specific and powerful manner than has been
                  previously assumed.},

                  activity, eye blinks and electrical noise is a
                  common and important problem in EEG research.  It is
                  now widely accepted that independent component
                  analysis (ICA) may be a useful tool for isolating
                  artifacts and/or cortical processes from
                  electroencephalographic (EEG) data. We present
                  results of simulations demonstrating that ICA
                  decomposition, here tested using three popular ICA
                  algorithms, Infomax, SOBI, and FastICA, can allow
                  more sensitive automated detection of small
                  non-brain artifacts than applying the same detection
                  methods directly to the scalp channel data. We
                  tested the upper bound performance of five methods
                  for detecting various types of artifacts by
                  separately optimizing and then applying them to
                  artifact-free EEG data into which we had added
                  simulated artifacts of several types, ranging in
                  size from thirty times smaller (-50 dB) to the size
                  of the EEG data themselves (0 dB). Of the methods
                  tested, those involving spectral thresholding were
                  most sensitive.  Except for muscle artifact
                  detection where we found no gain of using ICA, all
                  methods proved more sensitive when applied to the
                  ICA-decomposed data than applied to the raw scalp
                  data: the mean performance for ICA was higher and
                  situated at about two standard deviations away from
                  the performance distribution obtained on raw
                  data. We note that ICA decomposition also allows
                  simple subtraction of artifacts accounted for by
                  single independent components, and/or separate and
                  direct examination of the decomposed non-artifact
                  processes themselves.},

                  novel nonsense shapes using a negative priming
                  paradigm. The results showed that memory for shapes
                  can be formed in a single trial and without
                  attention, and that they last with little or no
                  decrement across two hundred intervening trials and
                  for delays of up to a month. No explicit memory of
                  the shapes is available, either immediately after
                  presentation or after a delay. Repetition of the
                  unattended shapes makes them easier to reject
                  without increasing the negative priming when they
                  are later attended. Attended viewing of the shapes
                  clears the negative priming. Changing tasks between
                  prime and probe trials shifts the negative priming
                  to facilitation or no priming. There appears to be a
                  dissociation between the memory of the shape and an
                  associated "action tag" which specifies whether it
                  was attended or ignored.  Representations of the
                  shapes survive longer and are more likely to
                  transfer between different experimental conditions
                  and tasks than the associated "action tags". The
                  processing level at which the representations are
                  formed appear to depend upon the requirements of the
                  particular task being performed. The results
                  demonstrate that lasting memories can be formed
                  without the benefit of attention, suggesting that
                  the role of attention may be simply to ensure
                  voluntary retrievability.  The surprising
                  combination of plasticity and permanence in implicit
                  memory for novel stimuli seen without attention
                  provides strong constraints on possible models of

                  for brain regions selectively activated by concepts
                  from four different categories--animals, fruit,
                  tools, and vehicles.  The second experiment used a
                  semantic categorisation task to increase the demands
                  on the semantic system and to look for evidence of
                  consistent activations for the domains of natural
                  kinds or man-made items. The final experiment was a
                  replication of the semantic categorisation task
                  using fMRI to increase the spatial resolution and
                  statistical sensitivity of the experiment. The
                  results of these experiments reliably identified a
                  distributed neural system common to both natural
                  kinds and artifacts but failed to find robust
                  evidence of functional segregation by domain or
                  categories. Category effects were neither reliable
                  nor consistently present across experiments although
                  some were consistent with previous studies. We
                  discuss the implications of these findings, arguing
                  that they are most consistent with a semantic system
                  undifferentiated by category at the neural level.},

                  information about how best to adapt a spatially
                  variable estimator, whether piecewise constant,
                  piecewise polynomial, variable knot spline, or
                  variable bandwidth kernel, to the unknown
                  function. Estimation with the aid of an oracle
                  offers dramatic advantages over traditional linear
                  estimation by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a
                  priori unclear whether such performance can be
                  obtained by a procedure relying on the data
                  alone. We describe a new principle for
                  spatially-adaptive estimation: selective wavelet
                  reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline
                  fits and piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped
                  with an oracle to select the knots, are not
                  dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet
                  reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a
                  practical spatially adaptive method, RiskShrink,
                  which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet
                  coefficients. RiskShrink used in connection with
                  sample rotation. Inclusion probabilities of any
                  order can be written explicitly in closed
                  form. Second-order inclusion probabilities
                  $\pi_{ij}$ satisfy the condition $0 < \pi_{ij} <
                  \pi_{i}\pi_j$, which guarantees Yates \& Grundy's
                  variance estimator to be unbiased, definable for all

                  smoothness from noisy sampled data. We introduce a
                  procedure, SureShrink, that suppresses noise by
                  thresholding the empirical wavelet coefficients. The
                  thresholding is adaptive: A threshold level is
                  assigned to each dyadic resolution level by the
                  principle of minimizing the Stein unbiased estimate
                  of risk (Sure) for threshold estimates. The
                  computational effort of the overall procedure is
                  order $N \cdot \log(N)$ as a function of the sample
                  size $N$. SureShrink is smoothness adaptive: If the
                  unknown function contains jumps, then the
                  reconstruction (essentially) does also; if the
                  unknown function has a smooth piece, then the
                  reconstruction is (essentially) as smooth as the
                  mother wavelet will allow. The procedure is in a
                  sense optimally smoothness adaptive: It is near
                  minimax simultaneously over a whole interval of the
                  Besov scale; the size of this interval depends on
                  the choice of mother wavelet. We know from a
                  previous paper by the authors that traditional
                  smoothing methods--kernels, splines, and orthogonal
                  series estimates--even with optimal choices of the
                  smoothing parameter, would be unable to perform in a
                  near-minimax way over many spaces in the Besov
                  scale. Examples of SureShrink are given. The
                  advantages of the method are particularly evident
                  when the underlying function has jump

                  equivalent inhibitory control in the three
                  groups. Experiment 2 assessed semantic inhibition in
                  a negative priming Stroop paradigm.  High-P
                  prisoners showed larger magnitudes of negative than
                  the other participant groups, and negative priming
                  magnitudes were more closely related to Factor 2 of
                  the PCL-R than to Factor 1. Experiment 3 assessed

  abstract = {Psychotropic drugs such as nicotine, and natural
                  rewards such as food, have been associated with a
                  release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens via
                  projections from the ventral tegmental area
                  (VTA). For many years this phenomenon was believed
                  to be the neural mechanism responsible for
                  subjective feelings of pleasure derived from
                  rewarding substances.  Data collected from animal
                  studies relatively recently (1990's) have caused
                  investigators to question the idea that dopamine in
                  the accumbens engenders pleasure. Electrophysiologic
                  and single unit recording studies of VTA and
                  accumbel responses to stimuli predicting reward have
                  clearly established that dopamine release can occur
                  well before ingestion and in some cases actually
                  peaks prior to ingestion of the reward. Furthermore,
                  studies of novelty and stress have determined that
                  dopamine is also released in these contexts. This
                  pattern of dopamine activation suggests that
                  dopamine release may occur in response to a broad
                  range of stimulus types, all of them having in
                  common the attribute of salience. In order to test
                  this hypothesis in human subjects, the idea was
                  explored from two levels: a physiological level and
                  a cognitive level. A functional MRI (fMRI) study was
                  performed in deprived smokers to identify which
                  brain substrates were preferentially activated by
                  visual smoking cues. The idea was studied from a
                  purely cognitive aspect by comparing the performance
                  of deprived and non-deprived smokers on reaction
                  time tasks. In the fMRI study, smoking cue stimuli
                  modulated a distributed neural circuit which
                  included neocortical areas known to be involved in
                  visuospatial attention (fusiform gyrus, parietal and
                  prefrontal cortex) as well as mesolimbic substrates
                  (VTA and nucleus accumbens). In the cognitive
                  studies, negative priming was decreased on the
                  craving as compared to the non-craving day.  We
                  conclude that a neural circuit encompassing
                  mesolimbic substrates and visual attention areas, is
                  activated in smokers due to the salience of visual
                  smoking cues. The increased activation of this
                  circuit as a result of craving, interferes with
                  cognitive processes dependent on the circuit for
                  salience detection in other contexts, such as the
                  processes operating during a negative priming task.},

                  suggest that processing is competitive in many brain
                  systems that code visual input. Competition is
                  biased towards stimuli that match task requirements
                  and is integrated between systems coding different
                  object properties. The result is flexible,
                  object-based attentional selection. In the second
                  part of the paper, I describe recent experiments on
                  attentional competition within and between sensory
                  modalities. Though competition is often modality

                  in visual search and how they interact with search
                  difficulty. Koshino (2001) observed evidence for
                  both target feature activation and distractor
                  features inhibition in conjunctive search, but
                  inhibition was evident only when search was
                  difficult (i.e., when there were a large number of
                  distractors in the display). Maljkovic and Nakayama
                  (1994), however, observed inhibition of distractor
                  features in a relatively easy search task using
                  pop-out targets. In the present studies search
                  difficulty was manipulated within each experiment by
                  varying target-distractor similarity and
                  distractor-distractor similarity. In all three
                  experiments, search displays were presented as prime
                  and probe pairs. Between prime and probe trials, the
                  targets and distractors were identical, reversed, or
                  completely unrelated. The target and distractors in
                  the prime trial were either physically similar or
                  dissimilar, and the distractors were either
                  homogenous or heterogeneous. In Experiment 1a, the
                  magnitude of facilitation (positive priming) was
                  greater when targets and distractors were dissimilar
                  (search was easy) than when they were similar
                  (search was difficult). However, the opposite was
                  true for inhibition (negative priming) effects. In
                  Experiment 1b, in addition to manipulating target
                  and distractor features between the prime and probe
                  trials, their locations were also systematically
                  manipulated, such that the target in the probe trial
                  was presented either in the same location as in the
                  prime trial, in one of the locations occupied by a
                  prime distractor, or in one of the previously
                  unoccupied locations. Target search was facilitated
                  when the target appeared in the same location in
                  both prime and probe trials, but there was no cost
                  associated with presenting the probe target in a
                  previous distractor location. Experiment 2 was a
                  replication of Experiment 1b, except that stimulus
                  similarity was held uniform in the probe trials and
                  manipulated only in the prime trials. Unlike in
                  Experiments 1a and 1b, the strength of distractor
                  feature inhibition did not vary statistically across
                  the similarity conditions, although the level of
                  inhibition observed was highest when the target and
                  distractors were similar. The results suggest that
                  the amount of inhibition observed may be a function
                  of search difficulty in both prime and probe
                  trials. Activation between trials was observed for
                  both featural and location information, but
                  inhibition was observed for featural information
                  only.},

                  familiarity (as opposed to recollection) is often
                  referred to as a rather automatic and context-free
                  process. Thus, in episodic object recognition,
                  familiarity and its electrophysiological ERP
                  signature are supposed to index prior occurrence of
                  an object independent of the context the object was
                  originally encountered in, e.g., [Ecker, U.K.H.,
                  Zimmer, H.D., Groh-Bordin, C., in press. Color and
                  context: An ERP study on intrinsic and extrinsic
                  feature binding in episodic
                  memory. Mem. Cogn.]). Yet, contextual sensitivity of
                  familiarity has also been reported (e.g., [Tsivilis,
                  D., Otten, L.J., Rugg, M.D., 2001. Context effects
                  on the neural correlates of recognition memory: An
                  electrophysiological study. Neuron 31,
                  497-505.]). We argue that considering attentional
                  and perceptual factors of target processing is vital
                  in understanding these conflicting
                  results. Presenting target objects on contextual
                  landscape scenes, we introduced a cueing technique
                  designed to focus subjects' attention on target
                  processing. We demonstrate that context effects on
                  familiarity are diminished if the attentional impact
                  of contextual stimuli is experimentally controlled,
                  arguing that contextual influences on object
                  familiarity are indirect and mediated by factors
                  such as salience and attentional capture. Results
                  suggest that salient context stimuli may elicit an
                  independent familiarity signal instead of directly
                  impacting on the familiarity signal of the target
                  object.  We conclude that (a) object familiarity is
                  in principle a rather automatic and context-free
                  process, and that (b) the study of episodic memory
                  can profit substantially from adopting a dynamic
                  processing perspective.},

                  context information is postulated to rely on two
                  distinct types of representation: object and
                  episodic tokens. These provide the basis for
                  familiarity and recollection,
                  respectively. Electrophysiological indices of these
                  processes (ERP old-new effects) were used together
                  with behavioral data to test these assumptions. We
                  manipulated an intrinsic object feature (color;
                  Experiment 1) and a contextual feature (background;
                  Experiments 1 and 2). In an inclusion task
                  (Experiment 1), the study-test manipulation of color
                  affected object recognition performance and
                  modulated ERP old-new effects associated with both
                  familiarity and recollection. In contrast, a
                  contextual manipulation had no effect, although both
                  intrinsic and extrinsic information was available in
                  a direct feature (source memory) test. When made
                  task relevant (exclusion task; Experiment 2),
                  however, context affected the ERP recollection
                  effect, while still leaving the ERP familiarity
                  effect uninfluenced.  We conclude that intrinsic
                  features bound in object tokens are involuntarily
                  processed during object recognition, thus
                  influencing familiarity, whereas context features
                  bound in episodic tokens are voluntarily accessed,
                  exclusively influencing recollection. Figures

                  current target stimulus or stimulus feature (the
                  "probe") that has been employed as a distractor
                  stimulus or stimulus feature on the previous trial
                  (the "prime"), representing strong evidence that
                  ignored information is actively processed to a high
                  level by selective attention systems. However,
                  theoretical accounts of NP differ in whether they
                  attribute the effect to processes of selective
                  inhibition or episodic memory retrieval. Here we
                  derived neurophysiological predictions from the
                  rival "selective inhibition" and "episodic
                  retrieval" models of NP, and employed event-related

                  responses to probe trials that were subject to
                  either no priming or negative priming.  Compared to
                  no-priming probe trials, NP resulted in increased

                  claim that sleep leads to improvements in recently
                  acquired, nondeclarative memories.  Examples include
                  motor-sequence learning; visual-discrimination
                  learning; and perceptual learning of a synthetic
                  language. In contrast, there are limited human data
                  supporting a benefit of sleep for declarative
                  (hippocampus-mediated) memory in humans (for review,
                  see). This is particularly surprising given that
                  animal models (e.g.,) and neuroimaging studies
                  (e.g.,) predict that sleep facilitates
                  hippocampus-based memory consolidation. We
                  hypothesized that we could unmask the benefits of
                  sleep by challenging the declarative memory system
                  with competing information (interference). This is
                  the first study to demonstrate that sleep protects
                  declarative memories from subsequent associative
                  interference, and it has important implications for
                  understanding the neurobiology of memory

                  using a matching paradigm. Ss were 48 undergraduates
                  with normal visual accuracy in Japan. The ease of
                  perceptual target selection was determined by
                  magnitudes of interference. Stereoscopic depth was
                  used to manipulate the relative position of a
                  target, a distractor and a standard figure. The
                  results show: (1) that when the ease of perceptual
                  target selection was manipulated by separation of
                  the target from the distractor in depth, positive
                  priming occurred; however, the ease of target
                  selection turned out to be unnecessary in the
                  occurrence of priming effects; and (2) that when the
                  distractor and the standard figure were displayed at
                  the same depth plane, where the distractor was
                  supposed to interfere with the encoding of a
                  standard figure, negative priming occurred
                  consistently regardless of the ease of perceptual
                  target selection. These results suggest that an
                  inhibitory mechanism contributes to the suppression
                  of inappropriate processes by a distractor, and an
                  inhibitory mechanism actively keeps distractors from
                  interfering with standard figures.},

  abstract = {Repeated stimulus presentation (priming) is
                  generally associated with a reduction in neuronal
                  firing, macroscopically mirrored by a decrease in
                  oscillatory electrophysiological markers as well as
                  reduced hemodynamic responses. However, these
                  repetition effects seem to be dependent on stimulus
                  familiarity. We investigate the spatiotemporal
                  correlates of repetition priming in cortical
                  word-recognition networks and their modulation by
                  stimulus familiarity (i.e., words vs pseudowords).
                  Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
                  results show reduced activation for repeated words
                  in occipitotemporal cortical
                  regions. Electroencephalogram recordings reveal a
                  significant reduction of induced gamma-band
                  responses (GBRs) between 200 and 350 ms after
                  stimulus onset, accompanied by a decrease in phase
                  synchrony between electrode positions. Pseudoword
                  repetition, in contrast, leads to an activation
                  increase in the same areas, to increased GBRs, and
                  to an increased phase coupling. This spatiotemporal
                  repetition by stimulus type interaction suggests
                  that qualitatively distinct mechanisms are recruited
                  during repetition priming of familiar and unfamiliar
                  stimuli. Repetition of familiar stimuli leads to a
                  "sharpening" of extrastriate object representations,
                  whereas the repetition of unfamiliar stimuli results
                  in the "formation" of a novel cortical network by
                  means of synchronized oscillatory activity. In
                  addition to isolating these mechanisms, the present
                  study provides the first evidence for a possible
                  link between induced electrophysiological and

                  judgment. Priming--that is, the impact of activated
                  knowledge structures on subsequent reactions--has
                  become a major experimental tool in contemporary
                  cognitive and social psychology.  The author is
                  concerned with semantic priming as a direct means of
                  influencing evaluations, or judgments and behavioral
                  decisions with a clear evaluative component. He
                  argues that in psychological approaches to
                  higher-order cognitive processes references to
                  priming run the risk of being caught in the same
                  positive-testing trap as Wason's participants. Due
                  to the habit of positive testing, researchers have
                  mainly studied whether the basic priming rule works
                  in the area of evaluative judgment, thereby missing
                  broader evidence on other rules that are also valid
                  and that supplement and moderate priming processes
                  in evaluative judgment. These might be termed

                  the potentially disruptive impact of a

                  significance of startle inhibition by comparing it
                  with 5 behavioral cognitive/clinical measures that

                  accounted for the variance between the

                  performance on a number of standardized measures of
                  lexical knowledge, language, and reading. Results

                  incompatible distractor letters on prime and probe

                  self-report measure of disturbances in memory,
                  identity, awareness, and thought) and a computerized
                  negative priming task (a reaction-time measure of
                  the extent to which distracting visual information
                  is inhibited from access to verbal report). Both
                  between-group and correlational comparisons
                  demonstrated significant relationships between a
                  "high" frequency of reported dissociative
                  experiences and a reduced ability to inhibit the
                  emotional identification of threat words. "High"
                  dissociators also demonstrated a superior ability to
                  inhibit the location of threat words and to inhibit
                  the identification of neutral words. These effects
                  confirmed three of four hypotheses derived from a
                  theoretical model of dissociation emphasizing the
                  role of cognitive inhibition as "the mechanism which
                  controls and limits the contents of consciousness"
                  (Frith, 1979, p. 225). The finding of superior
                  inhibition for the identification of neutral words
                  was not explicitly predicted, but can be assimilated
                  within the proposed model. Results are interpreted
                  as providing supportive evidence for cognitive
                  inhibition as a mechanism underlying both the
                  "intrusive" (described as abrupt shifts in thought,
                  behavior, and perceived self-identity) and
                  "avoidant" (described by the ability to ignore
                  painful experiences) aspects of dissociation. These
                  findings are seen as providing an empirical
                  framework for the investigation of dissociative
                  processes, while having important implications for
                  the assessment and treatment of dissociative

  abstract = {Despite the immense popularity of inhibition as an
                  explanation for behaviors in a variety of domains,
                  the definition of inhibition is murky, in that the
                  term inhibition has been used to describe a variety
                  of potentially different processes. This study used
                  latent variable analysis on data from 220 college
                  students to examine the relations between three
                  often-postulated inhibition functions-prepotent
                  response inhibition, resistance to distractor
                  interference, and resistance to proactive
                  interference-and their contributions to other
                  cognitive functions. Confirmatory factor analysis
                  suggested that prepotent response inhibition and
                  resistance to distractor interference were
                  indistinguishable at the level of latent variables,
                  but both of these functions were unrelated to
                  resistance to proactive interference.  Further,
                  structural equation modeling indicated that the
                  prepotent response/distractor inhibition and
                  resistance to proactive interference functions were
                  differentially involved in the other cognitive
                  abilities measured. Specifically, mental set
                  shifting and everyday cognitive failures were
                  related to prepotent response/distractor inhibition,
                  thought suppression was related to resistance to
                  proactive interference, and reading span performance
                  was related to both prepotent response/distractor
                  inhibition and resistance to proactive
                  interference. Negative priming (measured with a
                  latent variable) was not related to either
                  inhibition function. These results suggest that the
                  term inhibition has been overextended and, hence,
                  that theorists and researchers may need to be more
                  specific when discussing and measuring
                  inhibition-related functions.},

                  responses become integrated into "event files"
                  (Hommel, 1998) in memory so that a second encounter
                  with a specific stimulus automatically retrieves the
                  response that was previously associated with this

                  theories as introduced by Rothermund, Wentura, and
                  De Houwer (2005): In selection tasks where target
                  stimuli are accompanied by distractors, responses to
                  target stimuli are automatically bound to distractor
                  stimuli as well; repeating the distractor should
                  retrieve the response to the target that formerly
                  accompanied the distractor. In three experiments we
                  confirmed this prediction: Distractor repetition
                  facilitated responding in the probe in the case of
                  response repetition whereas repeating the distractor
                  delayed responding in the case of response change.},

                  responses to new targets, a finding called negative
                  priming (NP). The selective attention model, which
                  attributes NP to lingering inhibition of the prime
                  distractor, predicts that NP should occur only when
                  the prime display has disappeared before the probe
                  display is processed. The present study tested this
                  prediction both in easy- and in difficult selection
                  tasks. In Experiments 1, 2, and 3A, target selection
                  was easy, and NP was observed only after prime
                  display offset, regardless of whether offset was
                  manipulated between or within participants. In
                  Experiment 3B, target selection was difficult, and
                  NP was found with and without prime display

                  without prime display offset in a
                  difficult-selection task. A modified version of the

                  different effects from repeated distractors:
                  Inhibition theories always predict benefits, whereas
                  stimulus-response-retrieval theories predict an

                  people's responses to probe targets previously
                  presented as prime distractors are usually slower
                  and more error prone than to unrepeated stimuli. In
                  a typical NP experiment, each probe target is
                  accompanied by a distractor. It is an accepted,
                  albeit puzzling, finding that the NP effect depends
                  on the presence of these probe distractors; for,
                  without probe distractors, NP diminishes. This
                  phenomenon causes severe problems for the majority
                  of theoretical accounts of NP. In the present study,
                  we follow a simple argument, namely that without
                  probe distractors, the difficulty of responding to
                  the probe is so low that NP becomes
                  irrelevant. Hence, by increasing perceptual
                  processing difficulty, as well as by increasing
                  conceptual processing difficulty, significant NP
                  effects with constantly absent probe distractors can
                  be reliably observed. In addition, our results also
                  show that NP without probe distractors can be found
                  by exclusively manipulating probe display
                  processing. This finding furthers our understanding

                  stimulus-response (S-R) episodes or "event files" is
                  a basic process for the efficient control of
                  behavior. However, relevant information is usually
                  accompanied by information that is irrelevant for
                  the selection of action. Recent studies showed that
                  even irrelevant information is bound into event
                  files. In this study, we investigated the boundary
                  conditions of distractor-response binding and
                  subsequent distractor-based response retrieval
                  processes. In particular, we tested whether the
                  inclusion of distractor information into S-R
                  episodes is modulated by whether the distractor and
                  target stimulus are perceived as belonging to the
                  same object or as belonging to different objects. We
                  argue that distracting information is only bound
                  into S-R episodes if it is perceived as belonging to
                  the same object as the relevant information, whereas
                  no binding occurs when the distracting information
                  is perceived as belonging to a separate object. In 6
                  experiments, we found evidence for the modulation of
                  distractor-response bindings according to perceptual
                  grouping principles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

                  in hopes of using a new paradigm without perceptual

                  tested on a spatial NP task. Prime distractors and

                  that information pertinent to an individuals'
                  experience with alcohol is acquired and stored in a
                  semantic network of expectancies regarding the
                  effects of alcohol. Semantic priming using a lexical
                  decision task has been used to access memory
                  processes within a semantic network. The present
                  study involved screening 40 individuals with heavy
                  current drinking and 40 with minimal alcohol use and
                  presenting both groups with alcohol related primes
                  (e.g., "beer"), followed by alcohol expectancy
                  targets (e.g., "sociable") or non-word derivatives
                  (e.g., "hapby") in a lexical decision task. Subjects
                  were divided into groups with prime presentation
                  times that were either short (150 ms) or long (650
                  ms) to differentiate automatic from strategic
                  processing. Analysis of variance did not detect a
                  group difference in priming for expectancies primed
                  by alcohol words; instead, there was a trend towards
                  negative priming, or inhibition across groups. Free
                  recall data indicated that alcohol primes were more

                  behaviorally defined repetition priming effect have
                  provided useful insights into how visual information
                  is perceived and stored in the brain. Yet, although
                  both phenomena are typically associated with reduced
                  activation in visually responsive brain regions as a
                  result of stimulus repetition, it is presently
                  unknown whether they rely on common or dissociable
                  neural mechanisms. In an event-related fMRI
                  experiment, we manipulated fMRI adaptation and
                  repetition priming orthogonally. Subjects made
                  comparative size judgments for pairs of stimuli that
                  depicted either the same or different objects; some
                  of the pairs presented during scanning had been
                  shown previously and others were new. This design
                  allowed us to examine whether object-selective
                  regions in occipital and temporal cortex were
                  sensitive to adaptation, priming, or
                  both. Critically, it also allowed us to test whether
                  any region showing sensitivity to both manipulations
                  displayed interactive or additive effects. Only a
                  partial overlap was found between areas that were
                  sensitive to fMRI adaptation and those sensitive to
                  repetition priming. Moreover, in most of the
                  object-selective regions that showed both effects,
                  the reduced activation associated with the two
                  phenomena were additive rather than
                  interactive. Together, these findings suggest that
                  fMRI adaptation and repetition priming can be
                  dissociated from one another in terms of their

                  exhibits terminal decline at the end of

  abstract = {In an event-related potential (ERP) study of
                  varieties of negative priming (NP), 20 participants
                  performed two basic tasks, identification and
                  localization. NP was established in response times
                  (RTs) for two different conditions employed in the
                  literature, DT (distractor-target shifts between
                  subsequent displays), and DTTD (distractor-target
                  reversals). With identification, there were two
                  findings specific to DTTD: reduced amplitude of
                  frontocentral P200 and earlier onset of
                  response-locked lateralized readiness potential
                  (R-LRP). The pattern suggests that DTTD probes were
                  perceived as highly similar to the prime, causing a
                  tendency to repeat the prime
                  response. Identity-based DT had no significant ERP
                  correlate but was accompanied by wrong preactivation
                  in the stimulus-locked LRP (S-LRP). Regarding
                  localization, P300 seemed reduced with the DTTD
                  condition. However, current-source density (CSD)
                  analysis suggested additional frontal and occipital
                  N2 components, indicating inhibition of a tendency
                  to repeat the prime response and persisting
                  inhibition of the prime distractor location,
                  respectively. A larger frontopolar N440 accompanying
                  spatial NP suggested attempts to resolve conflicts
                  occurring at late stages of processing. Data support
                  the view of NP effects being caused by different
                  subprocesses. Furthermore, distinct brain processes
                  seem to underlie NP obtained from DT and DTTD
                  conditions.},

                  cognitive mechanisms involved. Thirty-six
                  participants performed both an identity- and a

                  stimulus/location from the immediately preceding
                  display produced behavioral PP. With localization,
                  but not with identification, behavioral NP was
                  observed when the target stimulus/location matched
                  the preceding distractor stimulus/location. Smaller
                  P300 amplitude accompanied identity-based PP,

                  The lateralized readiness potential, an index of

                  comprised of three experimental tasks designed to
                  explore this ability at three cognitive processing
                  levels: goal, categorical, and nonconscious. For the
                  goal and categorical levels, the negative priming
                  paradigm is used to examine the self-regulation of
                  affect for four emotions: Happy, Sad, Surprise, and
                  Anger. For the nonconscious level, an activation and
                  suppression paradigm is applied for these same
                  emotion categories.  The activation and suppression
                  paradigm yields limited support for the ability to
                  suppress emotions (emotion-expressing faces) at the
                  nonconscious level. No support was found for the
                  suppression or activation of emotions
                  (emotion-expressing words) at the categorical level.
                  Application of the negative priming paradigm at the
                  goal level provides limited support for the
                  suppression of goal level emotional stimuli
                  (emotion-expressing faces). The most impressive
                  evidence is the ability of subjects, at the goal
                  level, to express an emotion-related experience
                  based on a target stimuli while not expressing a
                  distractor emotion which they were required to
                  ignore. Also examined were the influence of

                  Orientation, Depression, and Self-Monitoring on
                  suppression ability; overall, no significant
                  relationship exists between the individual
                  difference variables and suppression
                  ability. Suggestions for future research are

                  discussed what memory is for. The current authors
                  assert that standard models of cognition are built
                  from abstract, amodal, arbitrary symbols, and the
                  meanings of those symbols are given solely by their
                  interrelations. The target article argues that these
                  models must be inadequate because meaning cannot
                  arise from relations among abstract symbols. For
                  cognitive representations to be meaningful they
                  must, at the least, be grounded; but abstract
                  symbols are difficult, if not impossible, to
                  ground. As an alternative, the target article
                  developed a framework in which representations are
                  grounded in perception and action, and hence are
                  embodied. Recent work (Glenberg \& Robertson 1999;

                  paradigm with a lexical decision task, in which the
                  prime and target could appear in either the same or

                  possibility that the neuropathology of Parkinson's
                  disease (PD) impairs the inhibitory mechanism of
                  attention while sparing the facilitatory mechanism.
                  It was further predicted that only
                  endogenously-evoked inhibition (that is, inhibition
                  driven by goal directed behavior) is disrupted in PD
                  with sparing of exogenously-evoked inhibition (that
                  is, inhibition driven by sensory information). Two
                  computerized experimental tasks were employed to
                  investigate these hypotheses in PD patients and
                  healthy control (HC) participants. Participants
                  completed an inhibition of return and negative
                  priming task on two occasions, and PD patients
                  completed each measure both on and off their
                  dopamine medication.  Results indicated that
                  patients with PD demonstrated intact
                  exogenously-evoked inhibition for a spatial
                  location, as evidenced in the inhibition of return
                  experiment, and impaired endogenously-evoked
                  inhibition for a spatial location, as evidenced in
                  the negative priming experiment.  These findings
                  support the idea that the characteristic motor
                  dysfunction in PD exists for voluntary or volitional
                  movements with relative sparing of automatic or
                  reflexive movements (Pollak, 1998). While current
                  models characterizing the cognitive impairment
                  associated with PD have focused primarily on the
                  motor disorder associated with PD, evidence exists
                  that suggests the same systems play a role in
                  higher-level cognitive processing (Alexander,
                  DeLong, \& Strick, 1986; Middleton \& Strick, 2000a,
                  2000b; Penney \& Young, 1986).  Based on this work,
                  the current study suggests that disruption in a
                  cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo circuit may be
                  important in producing the disruption of inhibitory
                  functions in PD. This study underscores the
                  importance of considering the connectivity of
                  neuroanatomical structures, and illustrates how the
                  impaired functioning of one structure may affect the
                  functioning of another structure downstream. It is
                  suggested that the ultimate effect of PD is
                  excessive inhibition of the thalamus and resultant
                  reduction in cortical excitation. This increased
                  thalamic inhibition results in the altered
                  functioning of specific thalamic nuclei as well as
                  frontal lobes that have been shown to be necessary
                  for endogenously-evoked inhibition.},

                  effects.  Consistent with several other recent
                  reports, this study found evidence of intact
                  inhibitory processing, as measured by negative
                  priming, in older adults (65-92 yrs old) as well as
                  younger adults (18-21 yrs old). This intact negative
                  priming occurred in conjunction with diminished
                  working memory span and impaired memory in the
                  discourse processing task in the same sample of
                  older adults, further arguing against the likelihood
                  that declines in these areas are caused by
                  impairments in the inhibitory processes measured by
                  negative priming.  The implications of these results

                  artifacts in ERP recording is described. The
                  procedure (EMPC) uses EOG and EEG records for
                  individual trials in an experimental session to
                  estimate a propagation factor which describes the
                  relationship between the EOG and EEG traces.  The
                  propagation factor is computed after stimulus-linkes
                  variability in both traces has been
                  removed. Different propagation factors are computed
                  for blinks and eye movements. Tests are presented
                  which demonstrate the validity and reliability of
                  the procedure. ERPs derived from trials corrected by
                  EMCP are more similar to a `true' ERP than are ERPs
                  derived from either uncorrected or randomly
                  corrected trials.  The procedure also reduces the
                  difference between ERPs which are based on trials
                  with different degrees of EOG variance. Furthermore,
                  variability at each time point, across trials, is
                  reduced following correction. The propagation factor
                  decreases from frontal to parietal electrodes, and
                  is larger for saccades than blinks. It is more
                  consistent within experimental sessions than between
                  sessions. The major advantage of the procedure is
                  that it permits retention of all trials in an ERP
                  experiment, irrespective of ocular artifact. Thus,
                  studies of populations characterized by a high
                  degree of artifact, and those requiring eye
                  movements as part of the experimental task, are made
                  possible. Furthermore, there is no need to require
                  subjects to restrict eye movement activity. In
                  comparison to procedures suggested by others, EMCP
                  also has the advantage that separate correction
                  factors are computed for blinks and movements and
                  that these factors are based on data from the
                  experimental session itself rather than from a
                  separate calibration session.},

                  cognitive inhibition. It was predicted that higher

                  associated with higher creativity as reflected in

                  on stimulus repetition, because it was obtained with

                  Tipper, 1985) and is thought to reflect processes
                  mediating short-term behaviour. However, since the

                  found with meaningless stimuli across delays of 30
                  days (e.g., DeSchepper \& Treisman, 1996),
                  researchers have questioned the existence of
                  long-term negative priming effects.  Because
                  long-term negative priming could indicate that
                  task-irrelevant information leaves a memory trace
                  that impacts performance over time, such a finding
                  is of immense theoretical importance. Indeed, the

                  long-term negative priming as well as its generality
                  across different stimuli and conditions.  The
                  authors propose that the initial processes that
                  prevent response to irrelevant stimuli may be stored
                  in memory, where retrieval of these processes can

                  method was applied to an auditory oddball paradigm
                  in 7 healthy subjects.  This method combines a
                  multiresolution wavelet algorithm for signal
                  extraction and the Gabor transform to represent the
                  temporal evolution of the selected frequency
                  components. Phase-locked or evoked activity and also
                  non-phase-locked activity were computed for both
                  standard and target stimuli. RESULTS: The gamma band
                  frequency components differed between target and
                  non-target stimuli processing. The study showed an
                  early and mainly phase-locked oscillatory response
                  appearing around 26--28 ms after both standard and
                  target stimuli onset. This response showed a
                  spectral peak around 44 Hz for both stimuli. A late
                  oscillatory activity peaking at 37 Hz with a latency
                  around 360 ms was observed appearing only for target
                  stimuli. The latency of this late oscillatory
                  activity had a high correlation (P=0.002) to the

  abstract = {Perception is an active process in which our brains
                  use top-down influences to modulate afferent
                  information. To determine whether this modulation
                  might be based on oscillatory activity, we asked
                  seven subjects to detect a silence that appeared
                  randomly in a rhythmic auditory sequence, counting
                  the number of omissions ("count" task), or
                  responding to each omission with a right index
                  finger extension ("move" task).  Despite the absence
                  of physical stimuli, these tasks induced a
                  'non-phase-locked' gamma oscillation in
                  temporal-parietal areas, providing evidence of
                  intrinsically generated oscillatory activity during
                  top-down processing.  This oscillation is probably
                  related to the local neural activation that takes
                  place during the process of stimulus detection,
                  involving the functional comparison between the
                  tones and the absence of stimuli as well as the
                  auditory echoic memory processes. The amplitude of
                  the gamma oscillations was reduced with the
                  repetition of the tasks.  Moreover, it correlated
                  positively with the number of correctly detected
                  omissions and negatively with the reaction
                  time. These findings indicate that these
                  oscillations, like others described, may be
                  modulated by attentional processes. In summary, our
                  findings support the active and adaptive concept of
                  brain function that has emerged over recent years,
                  suggesting that the match of sensory information
                  with memory contents generates gamma oscillations.},

  abstract = {Fluctuations in the temporal durations of sensory
                  signals constitute a major source of variability
                  within natural stimulus ensembles. The neuronal
                  mechanisms through which sensory systems can
                  stabilize perception against such fluctuations are
                  largely unknown. An intriguing instantiation of such
                  robustness occurs in human speech perception, which
                  relies critically on temporal acoustic cues that are
                  embedded in signals with highly variable
                  duration. Across different instances of natural
                  speech, auditory cues can undergo temporal warping
                  that ranges from 2-fold compression to 2-fold
                  dilation without significant perceptual
                  impairment. Here, we report that
                  time-warp\^{a}invariant neuronal processing
                  can be subserved by the shunting action of synaptic
                  conductances that automatically rescales the
                  effective integration time of postsynaptic
                  neurons. We propose a novel spike-based learning
                  rule for synaptic conductances that adjusts the
                  degree of synaptic shunting to the temporal
                  processing requirements of a given task. Applying
                  this general biophysical mechanism to the example of
                  speech processing, we propose a neuronal network
                  model for time-warp\^{a}invariant word
                  discrimination and demonstrate its excellent
                  performance on a standard benchmark
                  speech-recognition task. Our results demonstrate the
                  important functional role of synaptic conductances
                  in spike-based neuronal information processing and
                  learning. The biophysics of temporal integration at
                  neuronal membranes can endow sensory pathways with
                  powerful time-warp\^{a}invariant
                  computational capabilities. The brain has a robust
                  ability to process sensory stimuli, even when those
                  stimuli are warped in time. The most prominent
                  example of such perceptual robustness occurs in
                  speech communication. Rates of speech can be highly
                  variable both within and across speakers, yet our
                  perceptions of words remain stable. The neuronal
                  mechanisms that subserve invariance to time warping
                  without compromising our ability to discriminate
                  between fine temporal cues have puzzled
                  neuroscientists for several decades. Here, we
                  describe a cellular process whereby auditory neurons
                  recalibrate, on the fly, their perceptual clocks and
                  allows them effectively to correct for temporal
                  fluctuations in the rate of incoming sensory
                  events. We demonstrate that this basic biophysical
                  mechanism allows simple neural architectures to
                  solve a standard benchmark speech-recognition task
                  with near perfect performance. This proposed
                  mechanism for time-warp\^{a}invariant neural
                  processing leads to novel hypotheses about the
                  origin of speech perception pathologies.},

                  "location" negative priming (NP) effect. In all
                  experiments, the probe trial always lacked a
                  distractor. We showed that the predictable absence
                  of a probe distractor caused the elimination of the
                  location NP effect when the prime trial contained
                  both a target and a distractor event (T + D?T), but
                  not when the prime contained only a to-be-ignored
                  distractor event (D?T) (Milliken, Tipper, Houghton,
                  \& Lupianez, 2000). The preservation of the NP
                  effect seen with the distractor-only prime trials
                  (D?T) was not the result of its lacking a
                  prime-trial selection, nor was it the consequence of
                  its representing a higher level of episodic
                  similarity than the T + D?T condition.  Finally, the
                  location NP effect observed for the D?T condition is
                  seemingly consistent with the view that location NP
                  and the inhibition-of-return effects share a common
                  underlying process (Milliken et al, 2000).},

                  particular, that young sleep-deprived adults perform
                  similarly to 60-year-old sleep-satiated adults on
                  some tasks of frontal lobe function. This
                  proposition was examined using a protocol viewed by
                  many to be a direct probe of nonvolitional attention
                  mechanisms associated with frontal lobe function. A
                  negative priming (NP) procedure was used to compare
                  performance between non-sleep-deprived (NSD) and
                  sleep-deprived (SD, 34 hr) young, healthy
                  adults. This protocol allowed for exploration of two
                  theories of the NP effect based on inhibitory or
                  memorial processes. Under conditions believed to
                  facilitate inhibitory processes a normal NP effect
                  was found for NSD (16 ms) and SD (9 ms)

                  memorial processes there was no NP effect following
                  SD, compared with a normal NP effect for NSD
                  participants (11 ms). Distractor interference was
                  also greater following SD. These findings do not
                  suggest a similar pattern of change following sleep
                  loss in healthy young adults to that of normal,

                  trial. In Experiment 1 (N= 64), a masked white
                  colour name was presented briefly before a Stroop
                  display. Negative priming in colour naming occurred
                  when the colour of the lettering for the Stroop
                  stimulus matched the colour name displayed in the
                  first display, consistent with the proposal of
                  temporal discrimination theory that negative priming
                  arises because a recurrence of an unattended
                  stimulus cannot readily be classified as old or
                  new. Experiment 2 (N = 32) replicated negative
                  priming in the interleaved word display where
                  participants had to name the red word from a pair of
                  red and green words. In Experiment 3 (N= 32) and
                  Experiment 4 (N= 28) the participants were required
                  to attend to but not respond to the words in the
                  prime display and name one of two interleaved words
                  in the probe display.  Negative priming was observed
                  in this arrangement, consistent with the episodic
                  retrieval theory of negative priming. The temporal
                  discrimination model may need to be extended to
                  situations in which the attended stimuli have
                  different responses attached to them.},

                  hypothesis that one role of the right prefrontal

                  over a space of attributes, and are related by both
                  semantic and episodic associations. While semantic
                  relations are expressed through an hierarchical
                  coding over the attribute space, episodic links are
                  realized via specific synaptic projections. Due to
                  dynamic thresholds expressing neuronal fatigue, the
                  network's behavior is characterized by convergence
                  toward the concept patterns on a short time scale,

                  not in a global-directed one. These results

                  disentangled from intentionally driven components by
                  combining a task switch paradigm with a Go/NoGo
                  paradigm. It was argued that non-switches after Go
                  trials should selectively profit from
                  stimulus-driven repetition benefits, whereas
                  switches after NoGo trials should selectively suffer
                  from stimulus-driven negative priming. Finally,
                  intentional components of switch costs should be
                  assessable by reaction time differences between
                  switches after Go trials, which do not suffer from

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to human information
                  processing tend to deal with perception and action
                  planning in isolation, so that an adequate account
                  of the perception-action interface is still
                  missing. On the perceptual side, the dominant
                  cognitive view largely underestimates, and thus
                  fails to account for, the impact of action-related
                  processes on both the processing of perceptual
                  information and on perceptual learning. On the
                  action side, most approaches conceive of action
                  planning as a mere continuation of stimulus
                  processing, thus failing to account for the
                  goal-directedness of even the simplest reaction in
                  an experimental task. We propose a new framework for
                  a more adequate theoretical treatment of perception
                  and action planning, in which perceptual contents
                  and action plans are coded in a common
                  representational medium by feature codes with distal
                  reference. Perceived events (perceptions) and
                  to-be-produced events (actions) are equally
                  represented by integrated, task-tuned networks of
                  feature codes--cognitive structures we call event
                  codes. We give an overview of evidence from a wide
                  variety of empirical domains, such as spatial
                  stimulus-response compatibility, sensorimotor
                  synchronization, and ideomotor action, showing that
                  our main assumptions are well supported by the

                  distributed fashion, which raises the question of
                  how the codes referring to the same event are
                  related to each other. Recent findings suggest that
                  they are integrated into 'object files', episodic
                  bindings of object-related information. However, the
                  problem of integrating distributed codes is not
                  restricted to perception but applies to action
                  planning and sensorimotor processing as well. Here I
                  argue that the brain addresses these problems by
                  creating multi-layered networks of bindings - 'event
                  files' - that temporarily link codes of perceptual
                  events, the current task context, and the actions
                  performed therein. These bindings produce systematic
                  but often surprising and counter-intuitive
                  interactions between, and impairments in, perception
                  and action planning.},

                  created bindings between the response and the

                  a stimulus that is not primed. In each experiment
                  rats received initial training in which the
                  presentation of each of 2 serial compounds, A-X and
                  B-Y, was followed by the delivery of
                  food. Subsequently, X's capacity to elicit the CR,
                  approaching the site of food delivery, was assessed
                  when X was preceded by Stimulus A (i.e., primed) or

                  a more vigorous response when it was presented after
                  B than when it followed A. These results show that

                  by recognition of spoken monosyllables. The
                  network's computation can be understood through the
                  application of simple but generally unexploited
                  principles describing neural activity. The organism
                  is a network of very simple neurons and synapses;
                  the experiments are simulations. The network's
                  recognition capabilities are robust to variations
                  across speakers, simple masking noises, and large
                  variations in system parameters. The network
                  principles underlying recognition of short temporal
                  sequences are applied here to speech, but similar
                  ideas can be applied to aspects of vision, touch,
                  and olfaction. In this article, we describe only

  abstract = {A previous paper described a network of simple
                  integrate-and-fire neurons that contained output
                  neurons selective for specific spatiotemporal
                  patterns of inputs; only experimental results were
                  described. We now present the principles behind the
                  operation of this network and discuss how these
                  principles point to a general class of computational
                  operations that can be carried out easily and
                  naturally by networks of spiking neurons. Transient
                  synchrony of the action potentials of a group of
                  neurons is used to signal "recognition" of a
                  space-time pattern across the inputs of those
                  neurons. Appropriate synaptic coupling produces
                  synchrony when the inputs to these neurons are
                  nearly equal, leaving the neurons unsynchronized or
                  only weakly synchronized for other input
                  circumstances. When the input to this system comes
                  from timed past events represented by decaying delay
                  activity, the pattern of synaptic connections can be
                  set such that synchronization occurs only for
                  selected spatiotemporal patterns. We show how the
                  recognition is invariant to uniform time warp and
                  uniform intensity change of the input events. The
                  fundamental recognition event is a transient
                  collective synchronization, representing "many

                  dynamics of the Hopfield model. These functions
                  depend on the history of the individual spin (=
                  neuron). They reach a maximal height if the spin
                  remains constant. The resulting one-pattern model
                  has ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and periodic
                  phases. This model is solved by a master equation
                  and approximated by simplified systems of equations
                  that are substantiated by numerical
                  simulations. When several patterns are included as
                  memories in the model, it exhibits transitions—as
                  well as oscillations—between them. The latter can be
                  excluded by known methods. By introducing threshold
                  functions which affect only spins which remain
                  positive, thus mimicking fatigue of the individual
                  neurons, one can obtain open-ended movement in
                  pattern space. Using couplings which form pointers
                  from one pattern to another, our system leads to
                  self-driven temporal sequences of patterns,
                  resembling the process of associative thinking.},

                  exists. Motivated by the recent quantitative reports
                  of synaptic changes in AD, we use a neural network
                  model to investi- gate how the interplay between

                  pattern of memory deterioration, a clinical hallmark
                  of AD. Within the model we show that the
                  deterioration of memory retrieval due to synaptic
                  deletion can be much delayed by multiplying all the
                  remaining synaptic weights by a common factor which
                  keeps the average input to each neuron at the same
                  level. This parallels the experimental observation
                  that the total synaptic area per unit volume (TSA)

                  network model of selective attention is described
                  which employs a combined excitatory/inhibitory
                  architecture. A series of predictions regarding the
                  phenomena of INT and negative priming (NP) are then
                  derived from a simplified version of the model,
                  which focuses on the operation of one particular
                  aspect of it. Three experiments tested these
                  predictions. Exp 1, using 20 male Ss, tested the
                  prediction that representations of unattended
                  objects only drop below resting levels after the
                  stimulus is no longer present. There was a trend
                  towards increased INT and decreased NP when the
                  prime distractor remains on until the probe is
                  presented. In Exp 2, using 25 male Ss, it was

                  interact with the number of distracting
                  stimuli. Results of Exp 2 provide support for the
                  simulation. Both INT and NP are influenced by the
                  number of distractors in the prime display, whereas
                  attended priming effects are not. Using 20 male Ss,

                  ignoring an item on a prime trial can actually hurt
                  future performance on either that same item or
                  related items, producing identity or semantic
                  negative priming. However, the evidence for semantic
                  negative priming is scarce and the crucial factors
                  producing this effect are currently unknown. The
                  present experiments extend previous research by
                  examining the influence of association strength and
                  set size on both positive and negative semantic
                  priming. In Experiment 1, participants made lexical
                  decisions to "asymmetrically associated"
                  prime-targets pairs that contain a strong
                  association in one direction (e.g., from "stork" to
                  "baby"), but not in the other direction (e.g., from
                  "baby" to "stork"). These items were presented to
                  participants in either the forward (e.g.,
                  "stork-baby") or backward (e.g., "baby-stork')
                  direction. The critical new finding was that both
                  positive and negative semantic priming effects were
                  obtained only when prime-target pairs were presented
                  in the forward direction. Using a categorization
                  task, Experiment 2 again found positive semantic
                  priming, but failed to obtain negative semantic
                  priming suggesting the effect may depend upon the
                  use of a "binary" response such as a lexical
                  decision. Experiment 3 again used a categorization
                  task, but obtained both positive and negative
                  semantic priming using a small set of frequently
                  repeated strong associates. The pattern of semantic
                  negative priming observed across all three
                  experiments supports either (a) a "reaction
                  inhibition" model in which items associated to an
                  ignored prime distractor are inhibited during prime
                  selection or (b) a version of episodic retrieval
                  theory in which items associated to the ignored
                  prime distractor are tagged "do not respond" and the
                  future presentation of one of those items cues the
                  retrieval of the past "do not respond tag."},

  abstract = {One's actively ignoring a stimulus can impair

                  negative priming effect has been argued to
                  generalize to semantically related items as well,
                  but the evidence for this is still somewhat
                  weak. This article presents a new experiment in
                  which participants made lexical decisions to
                  asymmetrically associated prime-target pairs
                  presented in either the forward (e.g., stork-baby)
                  or backward (e.g., baby-stork) direction. The
                  critical new finding was that both attended positive

                  for prime-target pairs presented in the forward
                  direction.  The results support either (1) a

  abstract = {In this paper three experiments and corresponding
                  model simulations are reported that investigate the
                  priming of famous name recognition in order to
                  explore the structure of the part of the semantic
                  system dealing with people. Consistent with
                  empirical findings, novel computational simulations
                  using Burton et al.'s interactive activation and
                  competition model point to a conceptual distinction
                  between how priming is initiated in single- and
                  double-familiarity tasks, indicating that priming
                  should be weaker or non-existent for the
                  single-familiarity task. Experiment One demonstrates
                  that, within a double-familiarity framework using
                  famous names, categorial and associative priming are
                  reliable effects. Pushing the model to the limit, it
                  predicts that pairs of celebrities who are neither
                  associatively- nor categorially-related but who
                  share single biographical features, both died in a
                  car crash for example, should prime each
                  other. Experiment Two investigated this in a double
                  familiarity task but the effect was not observed. We
                  therefore simulated and realized a pairwise learning
                  task that was conceptually similar to the
                  double-familiarity decision task but allowed to
                  strengthen the underlying connections. Priming based
                  on a single biographical feature could be found both
                  in simulations and the experiment. The effect was
                  not due to visual or name similarity which were
                  controlled for and participants did not report using
                  the biographical links between the people to learn
                  the pairs. The results are interpreted to lend
                  further support to structural models of the memory
                  for persons. Furthermore, the results are consistent
                  with the idea that episodic features known about
                  people are stored in semantic memory and are
                  automatically activated when encountering that
                  person.},

  abstract = {The abilities to learn and to categorize are
                  fundamental for cognitive systems, be it animals or
                  machines, and therefore have attracted attention
                  from engineers and psychologists alike. Modern
                  machine learning methods and psychological models of
                  categorization are remarkably similar, partly
                  because these two fields share a common history in
                  artificial neural networks and reinforcement
                  learning. However, machine learning is now an
                  independent and mature field that has moved beyond
                  psychologically or neurally inspired algorithms
                  towards providing foundations for a theory of
                  learning that is rooted in statistics and functional
                  analysis. Much of this research is potentially
                  interesting for psychological theories of learning
                  and categorization but also hardly accessible for
                  psychologists. Here, we provide a tutorial
                  introduction to a popular class of machine learning
                  tools, called kernel methods. These methods are
                  closely related to perceptrons,
                  radial-basis-function neural networks and exemplar
                  theories of categorization. Recent theoretical
                  advances in machine learning are closely tied to the
                  idea that the similarity of patterns can be
                  encapsulated in a positive definite kernel. Such a
                  positive definite kernel can define a reproducing
                  kernel Hilbert space which allows one to use
                  powerful tools from functional analysis for the
                  analysis of learning algorithms. We give basic
                  explanations of some key concepts—the so-called
                  kernel trick, the representer theorem and
                  regularization—which may open up the possibility
                  that insights from machine learning can feed back
                  into psychology.},

                  phenomenon is termed priming and has been linked to
                  another widespread phenomenon called repetition
                  suppression, which is a repetition-induced reduction
                  in human brain activation as measured using
                  fMRI. Here, competing models of the neural basis of
                  repetition suppression were tested empirically. In a
                  backward masking paradigm, we found that effectively
                  masked object stimuli showed repetition enhancement
                  of brain activation instead of suppression. This
                  finding is consistent with an Accumulation model,
                  but is inconsistent with a Suppression model of
                  neural activity. Enhanced activation and the
                  improved behavioral performance usually associated
                  with priming are both explained by a shift in peak

                  the replay events in the two areas are related are
                  unknown. Here we studied multicell spiking patterns
                  in both the visual cortex and hippocampus during
                  slow-wave sleep in rats. We found that spiking
                  patterns not only in the cortex but also in the

                  periods of stepwise increase in neuronal population

                  artifacts in electroencephalographic (EEG)
                  data. Rejecting contaminated trials causes
                  substantial data loss, and restricting eye

                  based on blind source separation (BSS) for automatic
                  removal of electroocular artifacts from EEG
                  data. BBS is a signal-processing methodology that

                  noise, and line noise present serious problems for
                  electroencephalographic (EEG) interpretation and
                  analysis when rejecting contaminated EEG segments
                  results in an unacceptable data loss. Many methods
                  have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG
                  recordings, especially those arising from eye
                  movements and blinks. Often regression in the time
                  or frequency domain is performed on parallel EEG and
                  electrooculographic (EOG) recordings to derive
                  parameters characterizing the appearance and spread
                  of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. Because EEG
                  and ocular activity mix bidirectionally, regressing
                  out eye artifacts inevitably involves subtracting
                  relevant EEG signals from each record as well.
                  Regression methods become even more problematic when
                  a good regressing channel is not available for each
                  artifact source, as in the case of muscle
                  artifacts. Use of principal component analysis (PCA)
                  has been proposed to remove eye artifacts from
                  multichannel EEG. However, PCA cannot completely
                  separate eye artifacts from brain signals,
                  especially when they have comparable
                  amplitudes. Here, we propose a new and generally
                  applicable method for removing a wide variety of
                  artifacts from EEG records based on blind source
                  separation by independent component analysis
                  (ICA). Our results on EEG data collected from normal
                  and autistic subjects show that ICA can effectively
                  detect, separate, and remove contamination from a
                  wide variety of artifactual sources in EEG records
                  with results comparing favorably with those obtained
                  using regression and PCA methods. ICA can also be
                  used to analyze blink-related brain activity.},

                  preview field containing two or more letters is
                  followed by a target letter that is to be named. The
                  displays are designed to produce a perceptual
                  interpretation of the target as a new state of an
                  object that previously contained one of the
                  primes. The link is produced in different
                  experiments by a shared location, by a shared
                  relative position in a moving pattern, or by
                  successive appearance in the same moving frame. An
                  object-specific advantage is consistently observed:
                  naming is facilitated by a preview of the target, if
                  (and in some cases only if) the two appearances are
                  linked to the same object. The amount and the object
                  specificity of the preview benefit are not affected
                  by extending the preview duration to 1 s, or by
                  extending the temporal gap between fields to 590
                  ms. The results are interpreted in terms of a
                  reviewing process, which is triggered by the
                  appearance of the target and retrieves just one of
                  the previewed items. In the absence of an object
                  link, the reviewing item is selected at random. We

                  episodic representation, within which successive
                  states of an object are linked and integrated.},

                  prior information useful on some nonnegative priming

                  common nouns following a left-hemisphere CVA some
                  years earlier. She was found to show a striking

                  on the one hand, and famous faces and names, on the

                  and heritable among laboratory strains of
                  mice. Adult neurogenesis is also remarkably plastic
                  and can be modulated by environment and
                  activity. Here, we provide a systematic quantitative
                  analysis of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in two
                  large genetic reference panels of recombinant inbred
                  strains (BXD and AXB/BXA, n = 52 strains). We
                  combined data on variation in neurogenesis with a
                  new transcriptome database to extract a set of 190
                  genes with expression patterns that are also highly
                  variable and that covary with rates of (i) cell
                  proliferation, (ii) cell survival, or the numbers of
                  surviving (iii) new neurons, and (iv) astrocytes.
                  Expression of a subset of these
                  neurogenesis-associated transcripts was controlled
                  in cis across the BXD set. These self-modulating
                  genes are particularly interesting candidates to
                  control neurogenesis.  Among these were musashi
                  (Msi1h) and prominin1/CD133 (Prom1), both of which
                  are linked to stem-cell maintenance and
                  division. Twelve neurogenesis-associated transcripts
                  had significant cis-acting quantitative trait loci,
                  and, of these, six had plausible biological
                  association with adult neurogenesis (Prom1, Ssbp2,
                  Kcnq2, Ndufs2, Camk4, and Kcnj9). Only one
                  cis-acting candidate was linked to both neurogenesis
                  and gliogenesis, Rapgef6, a downstream target of ras
                  signaling. The use of genetic reference panels
                  coupled with phenotyping and global transcriptome
                  profiling thus allowed insight into the complexity
                  of the genetic control of adult neurogenesis.},

                  to attend to contralesional stimuli. There have been
                  many recent reports indicating that neglected
                  stimuli nonetheless undergo extensive perceptual and
                  semantic and processing in the absence of
                  attention. The present study examines whether
                  representations of such stimuli are subject to
                  inhibitory processes which may be involved in
                  selection: We report a study of negative priming for
                  stimuli presented in the neglected and non-neglected
                  visual fields in patients with unilateral neglect as
                  a result of posterior parietal injury. The results
                  indicate that negative priming can occur only for
                  previously ignored items which were presented in the
                  attended ipsilesional field during the prime trial
                  (Experiments 1 and 3). Experiment 2 demonstrates,
                  however, that these same stimuli can produce robust
                  positive priming in these same subjects. These
                  results differ markedly from those obtained from a
                  brain-injured control group consisting of patients
                  with similar lesions (posterior parietal damage) who

                  occur regardless of the field of presentation of
                  ignored distractor items. This study provides

                  briefly presented, each comprising a central target
                  square surrounded by elements. The task was to judge
                  whether the two targets were the same or
                  different. The organization of the background
                  elements stayed the same or changed, independently
                  of the targets. In different conditions, background
                  elements grouped into columns/rows by color

                  other elements was involved and the shape was

  abstract = {Developmental dyslexia is hypothesized to be complex
                  and to diffusely affect the visual system and its
                  related attention system. Thirteen dyslexics and
                  fifteen normal controls underwent
                  electrophysiological and reaction time data
                  collection. Subjects received visual stimulation
                  with colored words producing selective
                  inhibition. Stimuli generated negative priming,
                  attention switching, and Stroop effects. Analysis
                  was done to determine whether dyslexics were
                  impaired in selective suppression in comparison to
                  controls, thus differing from controls in negative
                  priming, switching, and in Stroop
                  interference. Frequency domain averaging and
                  division into 9 bands covering a range from 0 to 40
                  Hz was completed on electrophysiological
                  data. Predicted results failed to reach statistical
                  significance. However, younger dyslexics showed the
                  predicted effect of faster reaction times for both
                  the Stroop condition and the negative priming
                  condition in comparison to the identity condition
                  relative to younger controls. Further analysis
                  suggested that approximately 2-3 times more younger
                  subjects would be needed to achieve statistical
                  significance. Age, condition, their interaction, and
                  their interaction with group all proved
                  statistically significant. Also, the 3-way
                  interaction of age x condition x group proved
                  statistically significant for response
                  accuracy. Older dyslexics were not less accurate in
                  the switching condition vs. the average of the other
                  3 conditions; however, the other groups experienced
                  a 7-13% decrement in accuracy for the switching
                  condition. The effect of gender was statistically
                  significant, with females producing more errors than
                  males. Predicted electrophysiological results did
                  not achieve statistical significance. Nonetheless,
                  the data suggest a trend in the predicted direction
                  of increased delta, beta, gamma, and decreased
                  alpha. The most prominent difference occurred as an
                  increase in power in mid and high beta and gamma in
                  the frontal areas for dyslexics in contrast to
                  controls. This activity occurred in the identity,
                  negative priming, and switching conditions. This
                  finding is consistent with fMRI studies showing
                  relative overactivation of anterior areas and
                  underactivation of posterior areas. Lack of left
                  frontal activity in Stroop is consistent with other
                  research implicating anterior cingulate. Control
                  subjects failed to produce the left frontal activity
                  in the corresponding frequency bands for any of the
                  conditions.},

                  extremely and moderately positive or negative Polish
                  target words. In Exp 1 (80 college students) the
                  prime duration was 100 msec and in Exp 2 (80 law and

  abstract = {Among many theories in visual attention, one of the
                  most influential is Treisman's Feature Integration
                  Theory (FIT) of attention. Some recent results
                  cannot be explained by the original version of FIT,
                  and modifications of the theory are on-going. In
                  order to investigate whether feature integration is
                  based on activation of relevant feature dimensions
                  or inhibition of irrelevant dimensions, a negative
                  priming paradigm was used in conjunction with a
                  visual search task in the present studies. In
                  Experiment 1, the negative paradigm was employed in
                  a visual search task in which a target was defined
                  by the conjunction of color and form. The target was
                  present or absent in a display consisting of either
                  5 or 9 items. A prime-probe design was used to
                  examine effects of negative priming, in which
                  relationships between prime and probe displays were
                  manipulated, but those between the probe and the
                  next prime display were randomized. Because the
                  target to be searched was presented before the probe
                  trials, it was a task-relevant intervening
                  event. Therefore, effects of task-relevant
                  intervening events on negative priming was also
                  examined because they have not been investigated in
                  previous studies. Critical manipulations included
                  the following four conditions: (1) the target and
                  distractors from the prime display were identical to
                  those of the probe display (Identical), (2) a
                  distractor color from the prime display became the
                  target color in the probe display (Color Reversed),
                  (3) a distractor form from the prime display became
                  the target form in the probe display (Form
                  Reversed), and (4) the color and form of the
                  distractors from the prime display were combined to
                  define the target in the probe display (Both
                  Reversed). The response time differences between
                  these conditions and an Unrelated condition, in
                  which there were no relationships between the prime
                  and probe displays, were used as the measures of
                  priming. The results showed negative priming effects

                  of synchrony between two or more spike trains have
                  been proposed. One of the most recent methods is the
                  ISI-distance which extracts information from the
                  interspike intervals (ISIs) by evaluating the ratio
                  of the instantaneous firing rates. In contrast to
                  most previously proposed measures it is parameter
                  free and time-scale independent. However, it is not
                  well suited to track changes in synchrony that are
                  based on spike coincidences. Here we propose the
                  SPIKE-distance, a complementary measure which is
                  sensitive to spike coincidences but still shares the
                  fundamental advantages of the ISI-distance. In
                  particular, it is easy to visualize in a
                  time-resolved manner and can be extended to a method
                  that is also applicable to larger sets of spike
                  trains. We show the merit of the SPIKE-distance

  abstract = {Selective attention has been studied extensively
                  using the negative priming (NP) paradigm. An
                  important issue regards the representational level
                  at which NP occurs. We investigated this issue by
                  using numbers as stimuli. Because numbers have a
                  well-defined semantic organization, which can be
                  clearly measured by means of the distance effect,
                  they are very suitable for testing the assumption
                  that NP is situated at a central semantic
                  level. Four experiments are presented in which the
                  numerical distance between prime distractor and
                  probe target was manipulated. The task was magnitude
                  comparison. Target and distractor were defined on
                  the basis of colour. In Experiment 1, all numbers
                  were presented in Arabic format; NP was observed
                  only with identical prime distractor and probe
                  target, and no distance-related NP was
                  observed. This could not be explained by a decay of
                  inhibition since in Experiment 2 similar results
                  were obtained with a shortened response-to-stimulus
                  interval. Experiment 3 showed that these
                  observations also hold for numbers presented
                  verbally. Nevertheless, a cross-notational
                  experiment with Arabic prime and verbal probe
                  (Experiment 4) revealed no NP whatsoever and
                  excluded the possibility that the absence of
                  distance-related negative priming was the result of
                  a fine-tuned inhibitory mechanism operating at the
                  semantic level. The results are considered in the
                  light of current theories of negative priming.},

                  framework, immediate priming costs arise from a
                  match between a prime and probe event on 1 dimension
                  and a difference between those 2 events on some
                  other dimension (i.e., a partial match). In
                  Experiment 1, the authors used a Stroop priming
                  procedure to generate 6 variants of partial match,
                  yet only 1 of these 6 conditions yielded a partial
                  match cost. Experiment 2 demonstrates that, for some
                  of these conditions, an underlying partial match
                  cost was obscured by the contribution of an
                  independent source of facilitation to
                  performance. In Experiment 3, however, a partial
                  match was observed to have produced an immediate
                  priming cost only when the selective attention
                  demands of the probe task were high. Overall, the

                  distinguishing features. First, humans and other
                  animals routinely alter their behavior in response
                  to changes in their physical and social
                  environment. As a result, the outcomes of decisions
                  that depend on the behavior of multiple decision
                  makers are difficult to predict and require highly
                  adaptive decision-making strategies. Second,
                  decision makers may have preferences regarding
                  consequences to other individuals and therefore
                  choose their actions to improve or reduce the
                  well-being of others. Many neurobiological studies
                  have exploited game theory to probe the neural basis
                  of decision making and suggested that these features
                  of social decision making might be reflected in the

                  evaluation and reinforcement learning. Molecular

  abstract = {<para> In this study, higher order statistics-based
                  radial basis function network (RBF) was proposed for
                  evoked potentials (EPs). EPs provide useful
                  information on diagnosis of the nervous system. They
                  are time-varying signals typically buried in ongoing
                  EEG, and have to be extracted by special
                  methods. RBF with least mean square (LMS) algorithm
                  is an effective method to extract EPs. However,
                  using LMS algorithm usually encounters gradient
                  noise amplification problem, i.e., its performance
                  is sensitive to the selection of step sizes and
                  additional noise. Higher order statistics technique,
                  which can effectively suppress Gaussian and
                  symmetrically distributed non-Gaussian noises, was
                  used to reduce gradient noise amplification problem
                  on adaptation in this study. Simulations and human
                  experiments were also carried out in this
                  study. </para> ER -},

                  an everchanging array of differing objects, our
                  perceptual analysis of this environment may be
                  incomplete. It is traditionally assumed that
                  attentional processes determine how much of our
                  environment we come to understand (James,
                  1890). This assumption has led to the widely held
                  conclusion that there is no perception without
                  attention (Rock \& Gutman, 1981).  In a series of
                  experiments, a priming paradigm was used to
                  understand when, and if so, how the visual system
                  represents unattended shapes.  Observers in a
                  shape-matching task viewed overlapping novel shapes
                  with or without surface segmentation cues. Positive
                  priming (speeded judgments) occurred with opaque and
                  transparent surface-like shapes while negative
                  priming (slowed judgments) was found with outlined
                  and transparent shapes that lacked surface
                  segmentation cues. This effect generalized to
                  familiar and illusory shapes and held true even when
                  the number of ignored shapes increased. These
                  results suggest that the visual system analyzes and
                  represents unattended items and that visual
                  attention may best be understood in relation to
                  surface segmentation processes. A second series of
                  experiments was used to investigate one of the
                  central questions in visual science; namely, what is
                  the relative contribution of feed-forward and
                  feedback processes to visual perception? A
                  perceptual priming technique was used to assess the
                  impact of these two processes to object
                  representation.  While simplified, or lower level,
                  renditions of an object would prime more complex, or
                  higher level renditions of that same object, no
                  priming was found when the presentation order was
                  reversed. This pattern of results suggests that
                  perceptual priming is asymmetric and that feedback
                  mechanisms may not play a significant role in the
                  creation of object representations. In conclusion,
                  the results of these two series of experiments
                  suggest a fundamentally new approach to our
                  understanding of object representation and selective
                  attention.  Simply put, humans allocate their
                  attentional resources based on the surface
                  segmentation information that is normally available
                  in the physical world. Under these conditions, there
                  is perception without attention.},

                  cues. This effect generalized to familiar
                  shapes. These results support the importance of
                  segmentation cues in negative priming and suggest
                  that, under otherwise identical conditions, surface

                  1992) was evaluated in 3 experiments.  During
                  practice, regular word pairs were presented to Ss
                  differing numbers of times. Ss named specific target
                  words while they ignored specific distractor
                  words. Following a 5-min retention interval, memory
                  for practice was revealed: Test responses for target
                  words exhibited positive priming that increased with
                  increases in the number of times that the words had
                  been attended. Test responses for distractor words
                  exhibited either positive priming (Exp 1) or
                  negative priming (Exps 2-3) that also increased with
                  increases in the number of times that the words had
                  been ignored. The type of priming that distractors
                  exhibited was determined by several contextual
                  similarities between the practice environment, in
                  which distractors were ignored initially, and the
                  test environments, in which they were processed
                  subsequently.  Negative priming increased with
                  increases in the number of times that a distractor
                  was ignored and was sensitive to contextual changes.
                  This indicates that the direction of the effect was
                  temporally backward because the test probe cued
                  memory for earlier processing of the priming
                  stimulus when the distractor had been ignored.},

                  accomplished by using a referent size-selection task

                  in inhibitory processes are investigated
                  here. First, recent research has revealed that
                  negative priming (NP) effects can be caused by
                  different processes, distractor inhibition or
                  perceptual review. Therefore, conclusions concerning
                  reduced inhibition in patients with schizophrenia
                  are not possible from previous NP
                  research. Secondly, previous NP studies have

                  reductions during tasks that elicit behavioral
                  priming. Here we present direct evidence for a
                  quantitative relation between neural activity
                  reductions and behavioral priming. Fifty-four
                  subjects performed a word classification task while
                  being scanned with functional MRI. Activity
                  reductions were found in multiple high-level
                  cortical regions including those within the
                  prefrontal cortex. Importantly, activity within
                  several of these regions, including the prefrontal
                  cortex, correlated with behavior such that greater
                  activity reductions associated with faster
                  performance. Whole-brain correlational analyses
                  confirmed the observation of anatomic overlap
                  between regions showing activity reductions and
                  those showing direct brain-behavioral
                  correlations. The finding of a quantitative relation
                  between neural and behavioral effects in frontal
                  regions suggests that repetition reduces frontally
                  mediated processing in a manner that ultimately
                  facilitates behavior.},

                  colleagues (e.g., P.  A. MacDonald and S. Joordens,
                  2000) reported unusually large negative priming
                  effects and claimed that attention to distractors,
                  counter to expectations, served to enhance the
                  magnitude of the effect. In 3 experiments using
                  their novel comparative judgment task, negative
                  priming was assessed using both a control condition
                  based on that of P. A. MacDonald, S. Joordens, and
                  K. N. Seergobin (1999) and one in which control
                  probe items exactly matched those on ignored
                  repetition trials. In MacDonald et al.'s unmatched
                  control condition, participants were faster than on
                  ignored repetition trials, but this difference was
                  reduced or absent when control items were
                  matched. This result led to the conclusion that the
                  apparently large negative priming effect reported by
                  MacDonald and colleagues may be an artifact arising
                  because judgments for a subset of their control
                  trials were relatively easier than for ignored
                  repetition trials.},

                  information-based approach to modeling
                  electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics. Most EEG
                  research focuses either on peaks 'evoked' in average
                  event-related potentials (ERPs) or on changes
                  'induced' in the EEG power spectrum by experimental
                  events. Although these measures are nearly
                  complementary, they do not fully model the
                  event-related dynamics in the data, and cannot
                  isolate the signals of the contributing cortical
                  areas. We propose that many ERPs and other EEG

                  non-hyperactive boys was measured in two
                  experiments. The use of the negative priming
                  paradigm allowed for the interpretation of
                  hyperactive/non-hyperactive differences in
                  performance within the framework of previously
                  developed process models. Previous studies of
                  hyperactivity have relied on measures of
                  distractibility as an index of selective attention,
                  and have lacked a method for exploring possible
                  deficits in underlying attention
                  mechanisms. Significantly reduced negative priming
                  produced by a school-based sample of hyperactive
                  boys as compared to age-matched non-hyperactive
                  peers was found across spatial localization and
                  letter identification tasks in Experiment 1. In
                  Experiment 2, negative priming produced in a letter
                  identification task by a clinic-based sample of boys
                  diagnosed with Attention-deficit Hyperactivity
                  Disorder (ADHD) was compared to that produced by
                  non-hyperactive controls. Combined data from the
                  letter identification tasks in Experiments I and 2
                  provided sufficient power to detect a between-group
                  difference statistically.  In an effort to account
                  for the relatively small and variable nature of the
                  hyperactive/non-hyperactive differences in negative
                  priming that were found, the influence of
                  hyperactive subgroups was examined and the
                  theoretical interpretation of negative priming
                  effects was reconsidered within the frameworks of
                  three current process models.  The findings of this
                  study are particularly significant with regard to
                  the reinforcement of inattention as a key deficit in
                  hyperactivity.},

                  when the distractor on one trial becomes the target
                  on the next. Following two popular accounts, the
                  effect might be due either to inhibitory processes
                  associated with the frontal cortex, or to an
                  ambiguity in the retrieval of episodic
                  information. We used event-related brain potentials
                  (ERPs) to identify the processing stage primarily
                  associated with negative priming. In an auditory
                  categorization task, reactions in negative priming
                  trials were compared to reactions in a standard
                  control (unrelated primes and probes) and a
                  repetition control (attended prime=ignored probe)

                  attenuation of a sustained parietal positivity
                  extending from 300 to 600 ms.  Because corresponding
                  ERP components were found to be sensitive to

                  preprime-prime intervals and prime-probe intervals
                  were manipulated. The ratio between the 2 intervals
                  determined the size of the negative priming effect.
                  Results are compatible with the episodic retrieval
                  account, according to which the retrieval of
                  inappropriate response information associated with
                  the previous distractor slows down responding when
                  that stimulus becomes the target. Experiment 2
                  tested a variant of this account, according to which
                  the retrieval of the prime response rather than the
                  retrieval of nonresponse information interferes with
                  responding.  Consistent with this variant,
                  participants erroneously responded with the prime
                  response more frequently in the ignored repetition
                  condition than in the control condition. Experiment
                  3 replicated this finding and generalized it to the
                  visual modality. The authors conclude that the
                  retrieval of the inappropriate prime response is a
                  determinant of the negative priming
                  phenomenon. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA,

  abstract = {Reactions to recently ignored stimuli are slowed
                  down or more error prone when compared to reactions
                  to control stimuli. This so-called negative priming
                  effect has been traditionally investigated in the
                  area of selective attention. More recent theory
                  developments conceptualize the negative priming
                  effect as a memory phenomenon. This review presents
                  four models to explain the phenomenon as well as
                  their essential empirical evidence. The review also
                  considers several negative priming characteristics –
                  that is stimulus modality, prime selection and prime
                  response requirement, probe interference, stimulus
                  repetition, aging and thought disorders, and
                  physiological correlates. On these bases, it is
                  concluded that only the distractor inhibition and
                  the episodic retrieval models have survived
                  empirical testing so far. Whereas evidence has
                  increased that negative priming clearly obeys memory
                  retrieval principles, the distractor inhibition
                  model has lost much of its persuasiveness within
                  recent years.},

                  visual stimuli has been shown to involve the
                  retrieval of prime response information as evidenced
                  by an increase of prime response errors to the
                  probes of ignored repetition trials compared to
                  control trials. We investigated whether prime
                  response retrieval processes were also present for
                  response modalities other than manual responding. In
                  an auditory four alternative forced choice task
                  participants either vocally or manually identified a
                  target sound while ignoring a distractor
                  sound. Negative priming was of equal size in both
                  response modalities. What is more, for both response
                  modalities, there was evidence of increased prime
                  response errors in ignored repetition trials
                  compared to control trials. The findings suggest
                  that retrieval of event files of the prime episode
                  including prime response information is a general
                  mechanism underlying the negative priming phenomenon

                  was designed to explain the normal processes of word
                  identification and how they are influenced by a
                  prior encounter with a word. The model accounts for
                  the findings of word identification experiments in
                  which words are flashed briefly. A crucial finding
                  is that prior encounters with words typically lead
                  to biases such that a previously encountered word is
                  more likely to be given as a response. However, for
                  low-frequency words, a prior encounter can improve
                  overall performance (J. S. Bowers, 1999;
                  E. M. Wagenmakers, R. Zeelenberg, \&
                  J. G. W. Raaijmakers, 2000). The authors show how

                  model are spurious, but the authors show that his
                  claims are incorrect. In sum, the authors argue for
                  a theoretical approach that offers a detailed
                  description of the cognitive processes of word
                  identification and explains performance across

  abstract = {The view that Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
                  Disorder (ADHD) is a disorder of inhibitory control
                  has recently gathered considerable support. Barkley
                  (1997a) proposed a model of ADHD in which response
                  inhibition is the primary deficit that sets the
                  stage for all of the observed deficits in executive
                  functioning and behaviour. Inhibition is a diverse
                  construct, however, and it is unlikely that children
                  who have deficits in one type of inhibition would
                  necessarily have deficits on all types of
                  inhibition. To assess the scope of the inhibitory
                  control deficit in ADHD, children with (n = 16) and
                  without (n = 24) ADHD were tested on seven different
                  measures of inhibition. Participants ranged in age
                  from 9 to 13 years, and the control and ADHD groups
                  were matched for age and sex. The results were
                  interpreted in the context of a recent taxonomy of
                  inhibition proposed by Nigg (2001).  Children with
                  ADHD had longer Stop Signal Reaction Times than
                  control children, and they made more exogenously
                  triggered premature saccades on the Memory-Guided
                  Saccade task. Each of these patterns reflects a
                  deficit in the ability to inhibit prepotent
                  responses or to stop ongoing responses; both are
                  subsumed under Nigg's Executive Motor
                  Inhibition. Children with ADHD showed more
                  interference on the Stroop Colour Word Task, but not
                  on the Simon and Flanker tasks. Kornblum's (1994)
                  dimensional overlap model provides a framework for
                  understanding the pattern across these three
                  measures of Executive Interference Control. There
                  were no group differences on the two measures of
                  Automatic Inhibition: Negative Priming and
                  Inhibition of Return. Taken together, these data
                  limit the scope of the inhibitory control deficit in
                  ADHD to response inhibition. The pattern of findings
                  provides support for Nigg's taxonomy of inhibition,
                  for Kornblum's dimensional overlap model of
                  interference, and for Barkley's model of ADHD.},

                  present here a generic stochastic model which
                  combines the growth dynamics of the population and
                  its internal evolution. Our model thereby accounts
                  for the fact that both evolutionary and growth
                  dynamics are based on individual reproduction events
                  and hence are highly coupled and stochastic in
                  nature. We exemplify our approach by studying the
                  dilemma of cooperation in growing populations and
                  show that genuinely stochastic events can ease the
                  dilemma by leading to a transient but robust

                  selective memory/learning deficits for the names of

                  some information on many celebrities whom she failed

                  detailed analyses of conceptual knowledge are
                  necessary before it is concluded that a subject with
                  proper name anomia suffers from a purely output
                  disorder, as opposed to a conceptual disorder. The
                  behaviour observed in APA is consistent with the
                  domain-specific hypothesis of conceptual
                  organisation (Caramazza \& Shelton, 1998), and in
                  this framework can be explained by assuming
                  selective damage to knowledge of conspecifics. The
                  anatomo-clinical correlates of our subject's
                  disorder are discussed with reference to recent
                  hypotheses on the neural structures representing
                  knowledge of familiar people.},

  abstract = {There is a great deal of variability in both the
                  rate at which second language (L2) learners progress
                  and the ultimate level of L2 fluency they
                  attain. The goal of the present study was to examine
                  cognitive factors that may contribute to individual
                  differences in L2 processing.  Past research
                  suggests that working memory span plays a role in
                  both first and second language processing. Other
                  research suggests that a critical factor in language
                  processing is not capacity per se, but the ability
                  to suppress irrelevant information. Suppression may
                  be particularly important in early stages of L2
                  acquisition because of the benefits it confers in
                  learning to conceptually mediate the L2 without
                  competition from L1; suppression may also be
                  important at later stages of L2 processing because
                  of the bilinguars need to control the relative
                  activation of two or more languages. Two experiments
                  examined the role of capacity and suppression in L2
                  processing. In Experiment 1 a group of native
                  English speakers learned a set of Dutch vocabulary
                  words under conditions that varied in their
                  processing demands. In Experiment 2 a group of
                  fluent Dutch-English bilinguals completed a set of
                  individual difference measures, a set of bilingual
                  language processing tasks, and a negative priming
                  task. Results suggest that working memory span may
                  be related to the strategies learners adopt at very
                  early stages of second language acquisition. In
                  fluent bilinguals, working memory seems to play a
                  larger role in forward translation (L1 to L2) than
                  in backward translation (L2 to L1). Results also
                  provide support for the idea that suppression is a
                  critical component of bilingual language
                  processing.},

                  we proposed that this attention-induced motion
                  blindness results from high-level inhibition
                  produced by the distractors. To investigate this, we
                  compared the extent of the attention-induced motion

                  inhibition tasks: Stroop colour naming and negative
                  priming. A negative correlation between Stroop

                  that this effect is caused by the appearance of

                  spatial localization task can occur when the ignored
                  distractor and subsequent target are identical.
                  However, feature mismatches can also lead to

                  support. Much of this support derives from studies
                  of negative priming. The authors note that the
                  attribution of negative priming to an inhibitory

                  the 2nd of the 2 displays. A single prime stimulus
                  was followed by either a single probe (Exp 3A) or a

                  stimulus presentation) were evaluated using a source
                  monitoring paradigm, and drug effects on selective
                  attention mechanisms were evaluated using a negative
                  priming paradigm, in 18 healthy Ss (aged 20-49
                  yrs). TZ and ZP produced very similar dose-related
                  effects on memory for target information. Both TZ
                  and ZP impaired Ss' ability to remember whether a
                  word stimulus had been presented to them on the
                  computer screen or whether they had been asked to
                  generate the stimulus based on an antonym cue
                  (memory for the origin of a stimulus). Results
                  suggest that TZ, but not ZP, impaired memory for the
                  screen location of picture stimuli (spatial
                  contextual information). Although both TZ and ZP
                  increased overall reaction time in the negative
                  priming task, only TZ increased the magnitude of
                  negative priming relative to placebo. Findings have
                  implications for the cognitive and pharmacological
                  mechanisms underlying drug-induced deficits in
                  specific memory and attentional processes.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the current study was to develop a
                  measure of emotional regulation based on the
                  negative priming paradigm and to provide some
                  evidence of the validity of the new measure. The
                  current study was focused on preconscious emotional
                  regulation processes and develops a negative priming
                  task in the context of emotion. To provide validity
                  evidence for the negative priming measure, the
                  current study also included several questionnaires
                  measuring emotion related constructs.  It also
                  included criterion variable measures including
                  recall, recognition, task satisfaction, the
                  Scrambled Sentence Task, editing, and depression.
                  The negative priming task yielded two kinds of
                  emotional regulation measures based on reaction time
                  and probe error. The pattern of relationships
                  between the negative priming measures and emotion
                  related measures suggested that the negative priming
                  task was actually measuring emotional regulation
                  processes. Especially the error measure at the
                  preconscious level showed significant predictions to
                  criterion variables including recall, task
                  satisfaction, depression, and editing task, whereas
                  the negative priming measure at the conscious level
                  did not show such significant
                  predictions. Affectivity and personality measures
                  significantly predicted some of the criterion
                  variables including depression and the Scrambled
                  Sentence Task. In addition, category error, which
                  was included as an experimental variable, showed
                  significant predictions to criterion variables. The
                  differential predictions of the negative priming
                  measures and the questionnaire measures suggested
                  that the negative priming task might be addressing a
                  broader range of emotional regulation processes. The
                  results of the current study provided some empirical
                  evidence for the utility of negative priming
                  paradigm in the study of emotional regulation. In
                  addition, the current study was the first that
                  provided empirical evidence for the predictability
                  of emotional processes to task performance. Other
                  theoretical and methodological implications, and
                  limitations were discussed, and suggestions for
                  future research were offered.},

  abstract = {Responses to recently ignored stimuli are often
                  slower than responses to new stimuli. This
                  slowing--referred to as negative priming--has been
                  cited as evidence for two important features of
                  selective attention.  Specifically, it is thought to
                  indicate that irrelevant stimuli are processed to
                  relatively deep levels of representation
                  (postcategorical) and that these stimuli are
                  subsequently inhibited. The research reported in
                  this dissertation was concerned with investigating
                  negative priming in detail, in part to assess the
                  validity of these interpretations, and in part to
                  learn more about the source of the slowing. In
                  chapter 1, five different models of negative priming
                  are presented. Three are classified as
                  inhibitory-selection models because they maintain
                  that negative priming is caused by an inhibitory
                  mechanism of selection.  The other two are
                  classified as post-selection models because they
                  maintain that the slowing is caused by a process
                  that occurs after selection, and that negative
                  priming is unrelated to selective attention.  In
                  four empirical chapters (chapters 2-5), the two
                  classes of models are contrasted. Three general
                  empirical points were gained from the research
                  reported in these chapters. First, it was
                  demonstrated that negative priming depends on
                  characteristics of the trial on which the slowing is
                  observed (i.e., after the inhibition has taken
                  place, according to inhibitory-selection
                  views). Second, it was demonstrated that negative
                  priming may occur only when, on the trial in which
                  the inhibition is supposed to take place, there is
                  substantial danger that a response may be made on
                  the basis of an incorrect stimulus.  Third it was
                  demonstrated that the level of representation with
                  which negative priming is associated is not
                  constant. Instead, it seems to vary depending on
                  both the task and the stimulus conditions under
                  which the slowing is observed. Finally, chapter 6
                  provides a summary of the results and an evaluation
                  of the five models. In addition},

                  further aim of the study was to disentangle the
                  modalities involved in negative priming performance,
                  since a reduction in negative priming, as revealed
                  by schizophrenics and schizotypes, might reflect a
                  failure to actively inhibit irrelevant information
                  (cognitive inhibition) as well as dyslexia or a
                  general slowness in information processing. 45
                  healthy adults (aged 18-57 yrs) were drawn from the
                  general population. After neuropsychological

                  involved in representing/processing certain
                  categories of conceptual knowledge. With regard to
                  the dissociation that has received the most
                  attention--between the domains of living things and
                  artifacts--a debate continues as to whether these
                  category-specific effects reflect neural
                  implementation of categories directly or some more
                  basic properties of brain organization. The present
                  positron emission tomography (PET) study addressed
                  this issue by probing explicitly for differential
                  activation associated with written names of objects
                  from the domains of living things or artifacts
                  during similarity judgments about different
                  attributes of these objects. Subjects viewed triads
                  of written object names and selected one of two
                  response words as more similar to a target word
                  according to a specified perceptual attribute
                  (typical color of the objects) or an associative
                  attribute (typical location of the objects). The
                  control task required a similarity judgment about
                  the number of syllables in the target and response
                  words. All tasks were performed under two different
                  stimulus conditions: names of living things and
                  names of artifacts. Judgments for both domains and
                  both attribute types activated an extensive,
                  distributed, left-hemisphere semantic system, but
                  showed some differential activation-particularly as
                  a function of attribute type. The left
                  temporo-occipito-parietal junction showed enhanced
                  activity for judgments about object location,
                  whereas the left anteromedial temporal cortex and
                  caudate nucleus were differentially activated by
                  color judgments. Smaller differences were seen for
                  living and nonliving domains, the positive findings
                  being largely consistent with previous studies using
                  objects; in particular, words denoting artifacts
                  produced enhanced activation in the left posterior
                  middle temporal gyrus. These results suggest that,
                  within a distributed conceptual system activated by
                  words, the more prominent neural distinction relates
                  to type of attribute.},

                  investigated the neural correlates of semantic
                  priming, where response to a word is facilitated
                  when preceded by a semantically related word. Nine
                  normal subjects were scanned while performing a
                  lexical decision task. Within this condition, the
                  proportion of related prime-target word pairs was
                  varied across scans from 0 to 100\%. The control
                  task involved letter decision on consonant letter
                  strings, controlling orthographic processing and
                  response selection. First, lexical decision
                  (relative to letter decision) activated regions
                  previously observed in lexicosemantic tasks, i.e.,
                  the left anterior and inferior temporal lobe and
                  left inferior frontal gyrus. Behavioral analysis
                  confirmed significant facilitation of lexical
                  decision to related targets (mean priming effect 68
                  ms). It also suggested the contribution of both
                  automatic and strategic processes, consistent with
                  theoretical accounts of priming. Automatic priming
                  was indicated by consistent RTs to related targets
                  irrespective of the proportion of related word pairs
                  per scan. Strategic processing was indicated by
                  decreases in RTs to nonwords as the proportion of
                  related targets increased. Nonlinear correlational
                  analysis of cerebral activity during lexical
                  decision revealed a neurophysiological correlate of
                  these behavioral effects in (i) the left anterior
                  temporal lobe (BA 38), a region involved in
                  lexicosemantic processing; (ii) the anterior
                  cingulate cortex, right premotor region (BA 6), and
                  right superior parietal lobe (BA 7), regions
                  associated with attentional processes. We conclude
                  that in this experimental context, semantic priming
                  involves both automatic and strategic processing.},

                  effects of extended wakefulness are well known. As
                  time awake increases, errors become more common and
                  are often attributed to lapses in attention. Such
                  lapses can be reflected in the error-related
                  negativity (Ne/ERN), a negative electroencephalogram
                  deflection occurring after errors and is thought to
                  be related to error detection or response conflict.
                  Following the Ne/ERN, a positive deflection (error
                  positivity, Pe) is also observed and is thought to
                  reflect further evaluation of the error. To elicit
                  Ne/ERNs, the Eriksen Flanker Task was administered
                  to 17 women (aged 19 -- 45 years) at two levels of
                  alertness (4 and 20 h awake). After extended
                  wakefulness, participants reported being
                  subjectively sleepier and performing worse, but
                  showed no significant difference in subjective
                  effort. Across alertness conditions, they reported a
                  similar number of subjective errors which closely
                  matched an objective analysis of the errors. The
                  Ne/ERN was not significantly reduced by sleepiness
                  in contrast to the Pe which was reduced. Behavioral
                  slowing after errors was larger in the alert than in
                  the sleepy condition.  These results show that after
                  20 h of wakefulness, individuals are reacting to
                  their errors. However, further evaluation of the
                  error, and remediation of these errors may be
                  impaired despite continued effort.},

                  that: (1) when the distractors were rotated, NP was
                  not obtained whether the targets were rotated or not
                  (Exps 1 \& 2); and (2) when the distractors were not
                  rotated, NP was obtained regardless of the targets'
                  rotation (Exp 3). These results suggest that the
                  inhibitory mechanism of attention may not operate on

                  regard to the relation between negative priming and
                  familiarity of stimuli. That is, Malley and Strayer
                  (1995; Strayer \& Grison, 1999) reported that the
                  more familiar the stimuli were, the larger negative
                  priming became (i.e., a positive correlation),
                  whereas DeSchepper and Treisman (1996; Treisman \&
                  DeSchepper, 1996) reported that the less familiar
                  the stimuli were, the larger negative priming became
                  (i.e., a negative correlation). These studies differ
                  not only in their experimental tasks (identification
                  vs. matching) but also in their respective manners
                  of arranging unfamiliar stimuli (pure vs. mixed). In
                  the present study, using an identical set of
                  stimuli, we examined whether these factors caused
                  the opposite results. An identification task with a
                  pure arrangement produced a positive correlation,
                  and a matching task with a mixed arrangement
                  produced a negative correlation. These results
                  suggest that the past opposing results are both

                  the probability that a word target is semantically
                  related to its prime (the relatedness proportion)
                  has been confounded with the probability that a
                  target is a nonword, given that it is unrelated to
                  its prime (the nonword ratio). This study
                  unconfounded these two probabilities in a lexical
                  decision task with category names as primes and with
                  high- and low-dominance exemplars as
                  targets. Semantic priming for high-dominance
                  exemplars was modulated by the relatedness
                  proportion and, to a lesser degree, by the nonword
                  ratio. However, the nonword ratio exerted a stronger
                  influence than did the relatedness proportion on
                  semantic priming for low-dominance exemplars and on
                  the nonword facilitation effect (i.e., the

                  follow a category name rather than a neutral XXX
                  prime). These results suggest that semantic priming
                  for lexical decisions is affected by both a
                  prospective prime-generated expectancy, modulated by
                  the relatedness proportion, and a retrospective

                  found that such negative priming effects dissipated
                  within a 2-sec interval between response and the
                  next stimulus, the response-stimulus interval
                  (RSI). However, experiments by S. P. Tipper et al,
                  (1991) found negative priming persisted unchanged
                  over RSIs from 1,350 to 6,600 msec. The current
                  experiments used a letter-matching procedure in
                  which target letters were flanked by irrelevant
                  letters. Negative priming was manifested by longer
                  reaction times (RTs) and more errors to letters that
                  had appeared as flankers in the preceding trial.
                  RSI was varied from 500 to 8,000 msec. Negative
                  priming diminished over the RSI, particularly within
                  the 1st sec. This effect did not depend on the
                  presence or absence of temporal uncertainty or on
                  Ss' awareness of intertrial relations. An episode

                  repeated stimulus is studied in two different
                  contexts and then is tested for recall or
                  recognition at a later point in time. Hence, it is
                  ambiguous whether the first occurrence interferes
                  with the "on-line" processing of the second
                  occurrence or whether the interference reflects
                  processes required for retrieval at the later
                  time. The present chapter is concerned with several
                  phenomena in which an initial occurrence interferes
                  with the immediate response to the second occurrence
                  of an identical or similar stimulus. The
                  prototypical case, negative priming, occurs when a
                  stimulus is first deliberately ignored on a prime
                  trial and then reappears as a target requiring a
                  response on a probe trial.  Research on the causes
                  of negative priming suggests a general theoretical
                  framework (transfer-inappropriate processing) that
                  may in turn apply to other phenomena in which
                  repetition hampers performance, including

                  decreased performance on a wide range of cognitive
                  tasks, it does not adversely affect all cognitive
                  processes to the same degree. Eysenck's cognitive
                  theory of anxiety (e.g., Eysenck \& Calvo, 1992)
                  accounts for these discrepant findings and
                  postulates that anxiety restricts working memory
                  (WM) capacity. According to this theory, the amount
                  of WM capacity required for successful performance
                  on a task determines whether cognitive processes are
                  affected by anxiety. Although recent research
                  supports Eysenck's theory, no investigation to date
                  elucidates the precise cognitive mechanism
                  underlying this restriction in WM. The goal of this
                  study was to extend Eysenck's theory by
                  investigating a possible mechanism underlying WM
                  restriction in anxiety. The mechanism investigated
                  in the present study functions to prevent irrelevant
                  information from entering into WM and to dismiss
                  information from WM when it is no longer considered
                  relevant to the task at hand. Both aspects of
                  functioning are critical to the cognitive
                  functioning of an individual.  Because WM is limited
                  in the amount of information that it can hold at any
                  one time, cognitive functioning will be impaired on
                  tasks that utilize relatively large amount of WM
                  capacity when valuable space in this system is
                  occupied by non-task relevant information.  It was
                  predicted that both aspects of the functioning of
                  this mechanism would be least efficient for
                  threatening material in anxious individuals and most
                  efficient for depressotypic information in depressed
                  individuals.  No differences in efficiency for
                  different word types were expected in normal control
                  individuals. To investigate these issues, this study
                  adapted a variant of a negative priming paradigm as
                  well as a variant of Sternberg's (1966) short-term
                  memory search paradigm for use with emotional words
                  and emotionally distressed participants.  The
                  findings from this study supported the initial
                  predictions: anxiety and depression are clearly
                  characterized by differential efficiency in the
                  mechanism thought to underlie restrictions in WM
                  capacity.  Implications of these findings and future
                  directions for research in this area are discussed.},

                  lexical decision task to investigate priming effects
                  produced by attended and ignored words. Ss were
                  college students. In the unilingual experiment,
                  accelerated lexical decisions to probe target words
                  resulted when the word matched the preceding target
                  word, whereas slowed lexical decisions to probe
                  target words resulted when the word matched the
                  preceding ignored nontarget word. In the bilingual
                  (English-Spanish) experiment, between-language,
                  rather than within-language, priming manipulations
                  were used. Although the ignored repetition negative
                  priming effect replicated across languages,
                  cross-language attended repetition positive priming
                  did not. This dissociation of priming effects in the
                  inter- versus intralanguage priming conditions
                  contradicts episodic retrieval accounts of negative
                  priming that deny the existence of selective
                  inhibitory processes. On the other hand, these
                  results support an extension of inhibition-based
                  accounts of negative priming, because they indicate
                  that inhibition can operate at two levels of
                  abstraction--local word and global
                  language--simultaneously.},

                  experiment was that the executive functions of the
                  frontal lobe play a dominant role in negative
                  priming. Sixty-one young adults performed various
                  inhibitory reading tasks in which the participants
                  identified red-target letters while inhibiting
                  green-distractor letters. Participants also
                  performed various inhibitory tasks that are commonly
                  used in estimating performance levels of executive
                  functions. The results of the inhibitory reading
                  tasks showed that these participants demonstrated an
                  interference effect and a facilitation effect;
                  however, an overall negative priming effect was not
                  found. Although a negative priming effect was not
                  achieved, 39% of the participants displayed negative
                  priming effects, 34% demonstrated positive priming
                  effects, and the remaining participants (26%) showed
                  no priming effects. A mixed factorial analysis
                  showed that the negative primers completed both the
                  reading tasks and the inhibitory tasks that involved
                  executive functions in less time than either the
                  positive primers or the no primers. A multiple
                  regression analysis was computed in which the
                  negative priming effect served as the dependent
                  variable and the various inhibitory measurements for
                  executive functions served as the independent
                  variables. The results of this analysis indicated
                  that the executive functions of the frontal lobe do
                  not serve as good predictors for the negative
                  priming effect. Therefore, no support was found for
                  the hypothesis that the executive functions play a
                  significant role in the inhibitory process of
                  negative priming. Interpretation of these findings
                  was that the type of priming demonstrated by the
                  participant during an inhibitory task was the result
                  of their individual differences in the speed of
                  processing.},

                  from an impairment in cognitive inhibition. Previous
                  studies have demonstrated that those high in
                  schizotypy demonstrate impairments in cognitive
                  inhibition in negative priming tasks. Previous
                  research has also indicated that this reduced
                  negative priming can also be influenced by gender
                  and neuroleptic medication. Three different tasks, a
                  primed Stroop task, a spatial location task, and
                  pairs of discordant and concordant word primes were
                  used to gain a better understanding of the nature of
                  this deficit. Three different groups of eighteen
                  subjects each were utilized (a group of medicated
                  chronic schizophrenic patients, a normal control
                  group recruited from the community, and a normal
                  control group recruited from the first-degree
                  relatives of schizophrenic patients). Both control
                  groups were clinically screened to ensure that they
                  were free from symptoms of the schizophrenia
                  spectrum disorders and Axis I diagnoses. Consistent
                  with previous research, the community normal control
                  subjects did demonstrate negative priming on the
                  Stroop task while neither the patients nor the
                  normal control group consisting of first-degree
                  relatives showed significant priming on the task.
                  However, the three groups did not demonstrate
                  significantly different negative priming on this
                  task. This finding appears to lend support to the
                  fact that neuroleptic medication normalizes the
                  negative priming effect. On the location task, all
                  three groups demonstrated significant negative
                  priming that did not differ between the groups. The
                  interaction between gender, group and condition was
                  significant in terms of the errors made on the
                  location task, due apparently, to the fact that
                  female patients tended to make more errors in the
                  negative priming condition than male
                  patients. Normal community controls performed
                  differently than patients or their family members in
                  that the normal controls appear to show slight
                  facilitation in the Discordant condition relative to
                  the unrelated condition. Suggestions for future
                  research include the use of a sample individuals
                  clinically diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum
                  personality disorders drawn from both the community
                  as well as from the first-degree relatives of

                  world, while at the same time preserving existing
                  knowledge) has been at the forefront of
                  computational memory research for several
                  decades. In this paper, we critically evaluate how
                  well the Complementary Learning Systems theory of
                  hippocampo-cortical interactions addresses the
                  stability-plasticity problem. We identify two major
                  challenges for the model: Finding a learning
                  algorithm for cortex and hippocampus that enacts
                  selective strengthening of weak memories, and
                  selective punishment of competing memories; and
                  preventing catastrophic forgetting in the case of
                  non-stationary environments (i.e. when items are
                  temporarily removed from the training set). We then
                  discuss potential solutions to these problems:
                  First, we describe a recently developed learning
                  algorithm that leverages neural oscillations to find
                  weak parts of memories (so they can be strengthened)
                  and strong competitors (so they can be punished),
                  and we show how this algorithm outperforms other
                  learning algorithms (CPCA Hebbian learning and
                  Leabra at memorizing overlapping patterns.  Second,
                  we describe how autonomous re-activation of memories
                  (separately in cortex and hippocampus) during REM
                  sleep, coupled with the oscillating learning
                  algorithm, can reduce the rate of forgetting of
                  input patterns that are no longer present in the
                  environment. We then present a simple demonstration
                  of how this process can prevent catastrophic
                  interference in an AB-AC learning paradigm.},

                  selecting stimuli based on location, but did not
                  exhibit negative priming when selecting stimuli
                  based on identity. Adolescents without mental
                  retardation exhibited negative priming under both
                  identity-based and location-based
                  conditions. Adolescents with and without mental
                  retardation exhibited an inhibition of return effect
                  that did not differ for the two groups. The only
                  significant correlation between the three tasks
                  occurred for the inhibition of return effect at a
                  300 msec SOA and the identity-based negative priming
                  effect.  Although little evidence was found to
                  suggest a relation between the two location-based
                  tasks, several arguments were made to explain why
                  the expected results were not obtained. These
                  explanations focused on the task differences between
                  inhibition of return studies on infants and
                  inhibition of return studies on adults, whether the
                  inhibition of return task adequately captured the
                  participants' attention, and trends in the data that
                  occurred in the direction that was originally
                  predicted.},

                  literature concern the extent and nature of the
                  processing of unattended visual information.  In an
                  earlier study, it was found that when individuals
                  make lexical decisions about one of two
                  simultaneously presented, visual letter strings, a
                  modulation of event-related potentials (ERPs) may be
                  observed when the unattended word is repeated on the
                  subsequent trial as the unattended word. This
                  modulation differs in polarity and scalp
                  distribution from that typically seen when attended
                  words are repeated. In seven experiments, it is
                  established that the ERP modulation for repeated
                  unattended words (a) is reliable and attributable to
                  the repeated unattended words rather than to
                  accompanying attended words, (b) can occur for words
                  repeated in a different location and in a different
                  font, (c) is associated with faster lexical decision
                  responses, (d) is not related to the mechanism that
                  underlies the slowing in reaction times to recently
                  ignored targets (negative priming), (e) can occur
                  for digits as well as words, and (f) is related to
                  ease of selection.  The occurrence of this ERP
                  modulation suggests that the processing of
                  unattended information can extend beyond elementary
                  physical features (to involve orthographic identity
                  in the case of words). This processing leaves a
                  representation in memory which can influence
                  subsequent processing for at least 3 s. The
                  qualitative differences between the ERP modulations
                  for repeated unattended and repeated attended
                  information suggest that repeated unattended
                  information is processed in a qualitatively
                  different manner than repeated attended information.
                  Repeated unattended information appears to benefit
                  from an inhibitory mechanism sometimes applied to
                  unattended information to enable selective
                  processing. The inhibited representation may carry
                  forward in time, making subsequent selections easier

                  systematic reduction of the negative priming effect
                  as the number of distractors in the prime display is
                  increased, as reported by Neumann and DeSchepper
                  (1992).  In Experiments 1 and 2, subjects were
                  presented visual displays in pairs. Inhibition was
                  observed when a distractor in the prime display
                  became a target in the next (probe) display and was
                  measured by increased response times to identifying
                  the target in the second display. In Experiment 1,
                  the location of the target was consistent. In
                  Experiment 2, the location of the target was
                  varied. In each experiment, the number of
                  distractors (one or three) and stimulus onset
                  asynchrony (SOA) were manipulated. Varying SOA was a
                  way of controlling subjects' processing of the prime
                  display before the onset of the probe display.  In
                  Experiment 1, due to the consistent and predictable
                  location of the target, there was no effect of
                  priming when comparing the negative priming to the
                  neutral trials. These results were explained in
                  terms of an early selection strategy when selection
                  is easy. In Experiment 2, the uncertain location of
                  the target from trial to trial forced the subjects
                  to process the distractors. In the one distractor
                  negative priming condition there was inhibition at
                  the long SOA and facilitation at the short
                  SOA. Facilitation at the short SOA provided evidence
                  for a lack of inhibition. In the three distractor
                  negative priming condition there was facilitation at
                  both the short and long SOAs.  This indicates that
                  the distractors were activated and remained active,
                  thus facilitating a response when one of the
                  distractors became a target in the subsequent
                  trial. The findings were explained in terms of a
                  limited resource attentional model in which there is
                  a lack of resources for inhibition to take place
                  when perceptual load is high. The resource account
                  of inhibition might explain why populations such as
                  children, older adults, and individuals with mental
                  retardation do not exhibit the negative priming
                  effect in an identity task with one distractor.},

                  mechanism that allows persons to screen out
                  irrelevant information. This study investigated the
                  effects of sexual assault on inhibition. Many sexual
                  assault survivors experience intrusive memories of
                  their assault that may be the result of deficient
                  inhibitory processes. On the other hand, assault
                  survivors often cope through avoidance which may
                  strengthen inhibitory processes. Other hypothesis
                  investigated the possibility that inhibitory
                  strength changes across the healing process and that
                  inhibition was related to trauma
                  symptomatology. Forty-four survivors of sexual
                  assault and seventy-nine non-assaulted controls were
                  tested on two measures of inhibition: directed
                  forgetting (a memory task) and negative priming (an
                  attention task). Half of each group received neutral
                  stimuli and half received both neutral stimuli and
                  stimuli relating to sexual assault (threat
                  stimuli). The assault group recalled more words
                  overall than the control group and recall was
                  greater for threat words than for neutral words. The
                  trauma group did not show an increase or a decrease
                  in inhibition. Although there were not enough
                  numbers to make conclusive judgments, inhibition
                  does not seem to change over time in sexual assault
                  survivors nor does it appear to depend on
                  symptomatology. The assault group did not show a
                  general cognitive deficit. Rather, persons in the
                  trauma group had greater recall of threatening
                  information compared to controls.  Mixed support for
                  the fear structure model proposed by Foa and Kozak
                  (1986 and the self-reference effect was found. In
                  addition, the directed forgetting data have
                  implications for the resource allocation model of
                  cognitive processes (Wingfield \& Byrnes,
                  1981). Clinically, the findings in this study
                  reemphasize the pervasive and long-lasting effects
                  of sexual assault, especially in terms of
                  depression, anxiety, and hypervigilance for stimuli
                  related to the trauma. These data indicate that the
                  exaggerated focus on threat typically associated
                  with persons diagnosed with PTSD may extend to
                  trauma survivors who do not develop PTSD.},

  abstract = {This thesis addresses the question of whether
                  inhibition plays any important role in attentional
                  selection. I focus on the negative priming (NP)
                  paradigm, which has been widely regarded as evidence
                  supporting inhibition. NP refers to the slowing of
                  response to the target in the nth display (the
                  "probe") when the target shares some properties with
                  the distractor in the (n-1)th display (the "prime").
                  According to Tipper and his colleagues (e.g.,
                  Allport, Tipper, \& Chmiel, 1985; Tipper, Brehaut,
                  \& Driver, 1990), the function of attention is to
                  select a target from among distractors, and this
                  selection is implemented by inhibiting
                  distractors. They argue that NP is a direct result
                  of this distractor inhibition. In Chapter II,
                  contrary to Tipper's claim, I show that selection
                  for a target is neither necessary nor sufficient for
                  NP in the spatial task developed by Tipper et
                  al. (1990). An alternative account of NP, the
                  "mismatching hypothesis", is proposed and then
                  supported. According to this hypothesis, NP is due
                  to the cost of changing the symbols which are bound
                  to a given location. In Chapter III, Tipper's more
                  recent evidence supporting the distractor inhibition
                  hypothesis (e.g., Milliken, Weaver, \& Tipper, 1994;
                  Tipper, Weaver, \& Houghton, 1994) is evaluated. In
                  their new NP task, Tipper and his colleagues found a
                  delay in a condition where the probe target was
                  exactly the same as the prime distractor.  Since
                  there was no mismatching, inhibition was proposed to
                  be the intervening mechanism of this delay. In
                  Chapter III, I proposed two alternative accounts of
                  the NP found in Tipper's new experiments.  According
                  to the cue-and-target "group mismatching"
                  hypothesis, the mismatching processes which occurred
                  between the prime and probe displays operated on the
                  entire cue-and-target group rather than on an
                  individual letter. According to the "attention
                  capture" hypothesis, the NP effect is due not to
                  slowing of response in the critical NP conditions
                  but rather to speedi},

                  stimulus board, and the search stimulus board. Exp 1
                  used a single factor within-S plan, and Exp 2 used a
                  2-factor within-S plan. In Exp 1 gaze point was
                  represented by a "+" sign shown for 750 ms, then the
                  priming board was shown for 50 ms, and the Ss'
                  reaction time (RT) to the priming target was
                  measured.  Where there was no target, Ss searched
                  for 600 ms, then the search stimulus board was shown
                  for 50 ms, and the Ss' RT was measured.  Feedback
                  was provided for 500 ms. Exp 2 was the same as Exp 1
                  except 2 target conditions were included. Ss
                  received directions and reacted to 1 of the 2
                  targets. (English abstract)},

                  nonsmokers (mean age 20.6). Spatial working memory
                  was assessed by a delayed response task. Delayed
                  response performance is associated with the
                  integrity of the dorsolateral prefrontal
                  cortex. Spatial interference and negative priming
                  tasks were used to assess spatial selective
                  attention. Nicotine impaired spatial working memory
                  in smokers, but it did not affect spatial selective
                  attention. This result suggests that nicotine may
                  impair dorsolateral prefrontal function, as assessed
                  by the spatial working memory task in young smokers

                  networking sites. However, little is known about how
                  much, why, and how they use these sites. In this
                  study, 92 undergraduates completed a diary-like
                  measure each day for a week, reporting daily time
                  use and responding to an activities checklist to
                  assess their use of the popular social networking
                  site, Facebook. At the end of the week, they also
                  completed a follow-up survey. Results indicated that
                  students use Facebook approximately 30 min
                  throughout the day as part of their daily
                  routine. Students communicated on Facebook using a
                  one-to-many style, in which they were the creators
                  disseminating content to their friends. Even so,
                  they spent more time observing content on Facebook
                  than actually posting content. Facebook was used
                  most often for social interaction, primarily with
                  friends with whom the students had a pre-established
                  relationship offline. In addition to classic
                  identity markers of emerging adulthood, such as
                  religion, political ideology, and work, young adults
                  also used media preferences to express their
                  identity. Implications of social networking site use

                  older adults perform on three negative priming
                  tasks. Each task examined the relationship between
                  negative priming and various memory phenomena (i.e.,
                  word frequency, imagery and depth of
                  processing). Two of these, however, met the May et
                  al.  (1995) criteria for measuring only
                  inhibition. So, the retrieval model predicts the
                  memory factors to moderate negative priming, but the
                  inhibition model does not. Although results were
                  inconsistent across tasks, they favor the memory
                  over inhibition model. For example, participants
                  showed more negative priming when asked to "name
                  which of two nouns weighed the most" (semantic
                  processing) then when asked to "name which of two
                  nouns has more letters" (nonsemantic processing).
                  Also, the May et al. criteria does a poor job
                  explaining the age differences produced in my tasks,
                  as older adults actually showed more identity
                  negative priming than younger adults in a condition
                  satisfying these criteria. Finally, a process
                  analysis showed little difference between the
                  inhibition and memory models anyway, and inhibition
                  researchers are advised to interpret negative
                  priming studies with caution.},

                  schizophrenia patients showing a reduction of

                  attempted to replicate these findings, but studied
                  psychotic symptoms rather than the broad diagnostic
                  category of schizophrenia.  Psychotic individuals

                  distractors. Experiment 2 used a negative priming

                  Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A study on the
                  wakefulness EEG, recorded during eyes closed and
                  open, was carried out on 150 AD patients
                  (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria). Fifty-two normal subjects
                  served as controls. RESULTS: A significant
                  prevalence of an EEG spectrum characterised by lack
                  of a dominant peak in the 6.5-12 Hz band was found
                  in early AD (EAD). Age of onset correlated inversely
                  with the 1-6.5 Hz relative powers and positively
                  with 6.5-12 Hz relative powers. A similar
                  correlation was also found when a subgroup of mild
                  initial AD was selected. Moreover, evidence of EEG
                  changes peculiar to early onset AD emerged when 3
                  subgroups (with age of onset < or =60, range 61-69
                  and > or =70 years) were compared. CONCLUSION:
                  Irrespective of the severity of disease, this study
                  provides evidence of specific changes of wakeful EEG
                  in patients affected by early-onset AD.},

                  was found for latency to retrieve the defined word
                  correctly, and this was not a function of whether
                  primes were ever correct. Some negative priming was
                  found in error probabilities following different
                  prime types, but errors were not more likely when
                  the prime was closely related to the word to be
                  retrieved, so negative priming was not due to
                  spreading inhibition. The data were interpreted in

                  positive priming from related words on latency to

                  retention. Sequential learning in these models leads
                  to 2 major problems. First, well-learned information

                  required, automatic activation of the congruent
                  response must first be inhibited. Shiu and Kornblum
                  (1996a) provided evidence for such inhibition in an
                  incongruent symbolic negative priming task. Reaction
                  time was longer when a trial's correct response was
                  the name of the stimulus from the previous trial
                  than when it was not. We report three experiments
                  that test this inhibition hypothesis for spatial
                  stimuli and responses. In Experiment 1, which used a
                  spatial mapping analogous to the symbolic mapping
                  used by Shiu and Komblum (1996a), a similar negative

                  simple transformational rules, a positive priming
                  effect was obtained.  The results suggest that
                  inhibition in response selection may depend on the

                  semantically related to the distractor (ignored
                  semantic repetition).  In Exp 1, cueing the location
                  of the prime target significantly reduced the

                  in a trial results in longer RTs in the following
                  trial in which to-be-ignored stimuli become
                  targets. This is due to the fact that the residual
                  inhibition of the distractor must be overcome before
                  the relevant response can be produced. Such negative
                  priming effects are wellknown inhibitory
                  after-effects and the focus of intensive
                  research. However, it seems reasonable to assume
                  that the use of inhibitory processes leaves
                  measurable after-effects in a variety of other tasks
                  and situations.  The aim of the present study was to
                  examine whether the after-effects of inhibition
                  could be obtained in a task measuring motor
                  inhibition.  37 college students completed a stop
                  signal task to examine the inhibition of

                  Ss were successful in inhibiting their
                  reactions. Moreover, inhibitory after-effects were
                  greater when both trials consisted of the same
                  primary task properties. Strategic effects might
                  explain part of the results, but there is evidence
                  that a specific inhibition of either the stimulus,
                  or the response to that stimulus, or both plays a
                  role in the constitution of the after-effects.},

                  intensively studied during recent years. Previous
                  work has shown the relevance of some features, such
                  as the synchronicity of the updating, the clustering
                  of the network, or the influence of the update
                  rule. This has been done, however, for concrete
                  settings with particular games, networks, and update
                  rules, with the consequence that some contradictions

                  topics is missing in the broader context of the
                  space of 2\&times;2 games. To address this issue, we

                  literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate
                  cognitive inhibition in schizophrenia and
                  TD. Additionally, the influence of the course of
                  disease and of medication were evaluated.  The NP
                  was used to compare TD patients (n = 17) with non-TD
                  (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 21). Results
                  showed similar performance among TD and non-TD
                  patients, and controls. No influence of the course
                  of disease or medication was found. Our results are
                  in line with recent studies, where patients,
                  irrespective of TD, show normal performance in the

                  dynamics. When continuing indefinitely, latching can
                  serve as a model of infinite recursion, which is

                  presents a structure, i.e. a rudimentary grammar
                  . We show here, with computer simulations, that
                  latching transitions cluster in a number of distinct
                  classes: effectively random transitions between
                  weakly correlated attractors; structured,

                  presented. Within-trial Stroop effects (interference
                  and facilitation) and between-trial priming effects
                  (negative and positive priming) were
                  measured. Clinical symptomatology and duration of
                  illness were also examined. At short RSIs of 500
                  msec, the Ss failed to exhibit NP. In contrast, the
                  control subjects exhibited normal NP at the short
                  RSI but this priming faded at the long 2000 msec RSI
                  and was no longer significant. The facilitatory
                  priming effects remained stable across time in both
                  groups. The results suggest that schizophrenia
                  patients are better able to inhibit irrelevant
                  stimuli that are immediate, but the sustainment of
                  inhibition across very short time intervals (500
                  msec) may fade.},

                  heterogeneous, in which some individuals have many
                  more contacts than others. This fact contrasts with
                  the traditional homogeneous setting used in studies
                  of evolutionary game dynamics. We incorporate
                  heterogeneity in the population by studying games on
                  graphs, in which the variability in connectivity
                  ranges from single-scale graphs, for which
                  heterogeneity is small and associated degree
                  distributions exhibit a Gaussian tale, to scale-free
                  graphs, for which heterogeneity is large with degree
                  distributions exhibiting a power-law behavior. We
                  study the evolution of cooperation, modeled in terms
                  of the most popular dilemmas of cooperation. We show
                  that, for all dilemmas, increasing heterogeneity
                  favors the emergence of cooperation, such that
                  long-term cooperative behavior easily resists
                  short-term noncooperative behavior. Moreover, we
                  show how cooperation depends on the intricate ties

                  encounter with a stimulus influences the subsequent
                  identification, production or classification of the
                  same or a related stimulus. Neuroimaging studies
                  have revealed that behavioral priming is typically
                  accompanied by reduced activity in several cortical
                  regions. We review recent studies that have
                  concerned two key issues. First, specificity effects
                  produced by changes between study and test in either
                  the physical features of stimuli or the behavioral
                  response reveal cortical sensitivity to the
                  perceptual, conceptual and stimulus-to-decision
                  mapping properties of primed items. Second,
                  correlations between behavioral priming and activity
                  reductions are robust across a range of tasks and
                  procedures in prefrontal regions but not in
                  posterior regions. On the basis of these recent
                  studies, we suggest that the reduction in cortical
                  activity during priming involves at least two
                  different mechanisms.},

                  that stereotype threat interferes with test

  abstract = {The psychological state colloquially known as
                  "mental fatigue" is a commonly experienced yet
                  poorly understood aspect of cognitive
                  functioning. During the past 100 years of
                  experimental investigation psychologists have
                  learned much about the behavioral and affective
                  changes associated with the fatigued state, but have
                  not yet succeeded in elucidating the mechanisms
                  underlying the increased distractibility,
                  impulsivity, and irritability that typically ensue
                  following periods of prolonged effortful
                  concentration. Conceptualizations of mental fatigue
                  as the dissemination of "fatigue-poisons," the
                  effects of overarousal, or as generalized cognitive
                  slowing are inconsistent with the available
                  evidence. This lack of progress has led some authors
                  to suggest that it may prove impossible to formulate
                  a unified theory of mental fatigue mechanisms. This
                  thesis counters such pessimism by presenting a
                  theoretical and empirical argument for
                  conceptualizing mental fatigue as the weakening of a
                  global, inhibitory cognitive process. The
                  theoretical portion of the thesis shows that this
                  conceptualization offers a neurologically plausible,
                  integrative, and parsimonious account of prior
                  findings concerning the behavioral effects of
                  prolonged mental work. The empirical portion
                  describes three experimental tests of the hypothesis
                  that prolonged mental work induces fatigue of a
                  global inhibitory cognitive process. The third and
                  most conclusive of the three experiments
                  demonstrated that a 20-minute fatigue manipulation
                  (continuous recall of auditorially-presented
                  numbers) reduced the amount of negative priming (a
                  reaction-time measure of inhibitory processing in
                  selective attention) on a subsequent
                  computer-administered letter-naming task. Notable
                  features of the work include the demonstration of
                  fatigue transfer effects across sensory modalities
                  and categories of information, the counter-intuitive
                  finding that prolonged mental work can decrease
                  response latency, and the combined use of
                  naturalistic and laboratory methods. The findings
                  are discussed in terms of their implications for
                  models of selective attention, for theories
                  concerning the nature of constraints on human
                  cognitive functioning, and for the emerging view of
                  inhibition as a unifying theoretical construct in
                  psychological science.},

  abstract = {According to one productive and influential approach
                  to cognition, categorization, object recognition,
                  and higher level cognitive processes operate on a
                  set of fixed features, which are the output of lower
                  level perceptual processes. In many situations,
                  however, it is the higher level cognitive process
                  being executed that influences the lower level
                  features that are created. Rather than viewing the
                  repertoire of features as being fixed by low-level
                  processes, we present a theory in which people
                  create features to subserve the representation and
                  categorization of objects. Two types of category
                  learning should be distinguished. Fixed space
                  category learning occurs when new categorizations
                  are representable with the available feature
                  set. Flexible space category learning occurs when
                  new categorizations cannot be represented with the
                  features available. Whether fixed or flexible,
                  learning depends on the featural contrasts and
                  similarities between the new category to be
                  represented and the individuals existing
                  concepts. Fixed feature approaches face one of two
                  problems with tasks that call for new features: If
                  the fixed features are fairly high level and
                  directly useful for categorization, then they will
                  not be flexible enough to represent all objects that
                  might be relevant for a new task. If the fixed
                  features are small, subsymbolic fragments (such as
                  pixels), then regularities at the level of the
                  functional features required to accomplish
                  categorizations will not be captured by these
                  primitives. We present evidence of flexible
                  perceptual changes arising from category learning
                  and theoretical arguments for the importance of this
                  flexibility. We describe conditions that promote
                  feature creation and argue against interpreting them
                  in terms of fixed features. Finally, we discuss the
                  implications of functional features for object
                  categorization, conceptual development, chunking,
                  constructive induction, and formal models of

  abstract = {Inattentional blindness refers to the finding that
                  people do not always see what appears in their
                  gaze. Though inattentional blindness affects large
                  percentages of people, it is unclear if there are
                  individual differences in susceptibility. The
                  present study addressed whether individual
                  differences in attentional control, as reflected by
                  variability in working memory capacity, modulate
                  susceptibility to inattentional
                  blindness. Participants watched a classic
                  inattentional blindness video (Simons \& Chabris,
                  1999) and were instructed to count passes among
                  basketball players, wherein 58\% noticed the
                  unexpected: a person wearing a gorilla suit. When
                  participants were accurate with their pass counts,
                  individuals with higher working memory capacity were
                  more likely to report seeing the gorilla (67\%) than
                  those with lesser working memory capacity
                  (36\%). These results suggest that variability in
                  attentional control is a potential mechanism
                  underlying the apparent modulation of inattentional
                  blindness across individuals. (PsycINFO Database

                  that are associated with a large-scale
                  spatio-temporal synchrony across neocortex. These
                  slow-wave complexes alternate with brief episodes of
                  fast oscillations, similar to the sustained fast
                  oscillations that occur during the wake state. We

                  spindle oscillations that open molecular gates to

                  and 'storing' information primed in neural

                  brain activity of the EEG gamma band and
                  event-related potentials (ERPs) with relation to the
                  difficulty of a visual discrimination task. METHODS:
                  Three tasks with identical stimulus material were
                  performed by 9 healthy subjects. The tasks comprised
                  a passive control task, and an easy and a hard
                  visual discrimination task, requiring discrimination
                  of the color of circles. EEG was recorded from 26
                  electrodes. A wavelet transform based on Morlet
                  wavelets was employed for the analysis of gamma
                  activity. RESULTS: Evoked EEG gamma activity was
                  enhanced by both discrimination tasks as compared to
                  the passive control task.  Within the two
                  discrimination tasks, the latency of the evoked
                  gamma peak was delayed for the harder task. Higher
                  amplitudes of the ERP components N170 and P300 were
                  found in both discrimination tasks as compared to
                  the passive task. The N2b, which showed a maximum
                  activation at about 260 ms, was increased in the
                  hard discrimination task as compared to the easy
                  discrimination task. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
                  indicate that early evoked gamma activity and N2b
                  are related to the difficulty of visual
                  discrimination processes. A delayed gamma activity
                  in the hard task indicated a longer duration of
                  stimulus processing, whereas the amplitude of the
                  N2b directly indicates the level of task
                  difficulty.},

                  contributes to meaning selection, then inhibitory

                  into how inhibition operates during meaning
                  selection.  In this chapter, we explore this
                  possibility with work on inhibitory processes in
                  memory retrieval. Although the analogy between
                  attentional selection and lexical ambiguity
                  resolution seems apt, there are substantial
                  differences in the cognitive situations posed by the
                  negative priming paradigm and by lexical ambiguity
                  resolution. Although a common mechanism may be
                  involved, one might wonder whether the properties of
                  negative priming and meaning selection need map onto
                  one another. To the extent that meaning selection
                  can be seen as a special case of retrieval, work on
                  inhibition in long-term memory may provide a closer
                  analogy.  In our work on retrieval, we have focused
                  considerable effort on excluding noninhibitory
                  alternatives by developing new methodologies for
                  isolating inhibition. In the first section, we
                  review our work on inhibitory processes in memory
                  retrieval and the findings that have led us to
                  conclude that inhibition is at work. In the second

                  methods to a paradigm relevant to ambiguity

                  algorithm (MMP) performs an iterative, exhaustive
                  search for waveforms, which optimally fit to signal
                  structures, persistent in all the responses (trials)
                  with the same time of occurrence, frequency, phase,
                  and time width, but varying amplitude. The search is
                  performed in a highly redundant time--frequency
                  dictionary of Gabor functions, i.e., sines modulated
                  by Gaussians. We present the feasibility of such a
                  single-trial MMP analysis of the auditory M100
                  response, using an illustrative dataset acquired in
                  a magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurement with
                  auditory stimulation with sinusoidal 1-kHz tones. We

                  be very well explained by the average reconstruction

                  single trials. The M100 peak amplitude of
                  single-trial reconstructions is observed to decrease
                  with repetitions, which indicates habituation to the

                  physiologically distinct components of evoked

                  inhibitory mechanisms of individuals suffering from
                  a severe CHI. Twenty participants with severe CHIs
                  (greater than 1 year postinjury) and 20 matched
                  controls completed a negative priming task, as well
                  as several other standardized tests of cognitive
                  functioning. Within the negative priming task, 2
                  conditions were used to elicit information regarding

                  18-24 yrs) engaged in the attention task, which was
                  then followed by 15 min of a stressful video game
                  before a return to the attentional task. Baseline
                  saliva samples were obtained before the experiment
                  began, 1 min after the video-game stressor, and 20
                  min post-stress.  Ss showed a significant reduction

                  CORT after stress, it seems likely that attentional
                  processes are under tight control by brain systems

                  attention processes in relatively remitted recent
                  onset schizophrenics and in normals scoring high on
                  measures of schizotypal characteristics. In
                  Experiment 1, a negative priming paradigm was used
                  to assess differences in inhibitory processes in
                  schizophrenics (n = 25) and a psychiatrically
                  screened normal comparison sample (n = 14). In
                  Experiment 2, independent samples of controls
                  scoring high (n = 16) and low (n = 15) on measures
                  of schizotypal characteristics were contrasted on
                  the same priming measure. In the computerized
                  priming paradigm, subjects were presented with lists
                  of stimuli (colored words presented in contrasting
                  colors) and instructed to name as quickly as
                  possible, the color of text (target), and ignore the
                  competing irrelevant word (distractor). Stimuli were
                  presented at three presentation times (100, 250,
                  500ms) to assess the effect of stimulus availability
                  on priming processes. By manipulating the
                  relationship between the distractor and target
                  across trials, three priming conditions were
                  developed: negative, positive, and interference.
                  The magnitude of the RT slowing in the negative
                  priming condition and RT speeding in the positive
                  priming condition were used as indices of the extent
                  of inhibition applied to the previous stimuli. The
                  interference condition was designed to assess the
                  efficiency of selection in the face of
                  distraction. Schizophrenics and schizotypals did not
                  differ from controls with regard to efficiency of
                  selection. Schizophrenics and schizotypals also
                  failed to demonstrate deficient inhibitory processes
                  in the form of attenuated priming
                  effects. Furthermore, the magnitude of priming
                  effects was not found to be related to the presence
                  of positive or negative symptoms in the
                  schizophrenics.  Priming effects interacted with
                  stimulus presentation times, with negative priming
                  occurring exclusively with brief stimulus
                  presentation times, and posit},

  abstract = {Knowledge of familiar people is essential to guide
                  social interaction, yet there is uncertainty about
                  whether semantic knowledge for people is stored in a
                  categorical structure as for objects. Four priming
                  experiments using hard-to-perceive primes
                  investigated whether occupation forms a category
                  connecting famous persons in semantic memory. Primes
                  were famous faces exposed for 17ms with masking,
                  resulting in severely restricted awareness and thus
                  precluding expectancy-based priming effects. Targets
                  were consciously perceptible famous faces
                  (Experiments 1-3), famous names (Experiment 3), or
                  occupations (Experiment 4) representing either the
                  same or different occupation to the
                  prime. Significant priming demonstrated the
                  operation of automatic processes, including
                  spreading activation, among persons sharing a common
                  occupation; this supports the categorical view. The
                  direction of priming (faster/slower responses to
                  same-occupation than different-occupation targets)
                  was dependent on prime-target stimulus onset
                  asynchrony (Experiments 1-3) and type of target
                  (Experiment 4). This pattern of results is
                  attributed to the Centre-Surround mechanism proposed
                  by Carr and Dagenbach [Carr, T. H., \& Dagenbach,

                  semantic knowledge for famous people and (b) the

                  model of person recognition proposes that
                  representations of known persons are connected by
                  shared semantic attributes. This predicts that
                  priming should be observed between persons from the
                  same category, e.g. famous persons with the same
                  occupation. Empirical investigations to date have
                  produced mixed results, and comparison of methods
                  suggests that priming based on shared occupation may
                  have been suppressed by the presence of prime-target
                  pairs representing a stronger relationship of close
                  association. In the present experiment, 72
                  participants performed a familiarity decision to
                  famous names preceded by close associates or members
                  of the same occupational category. As predicted,
                  categorical priming was observed in the group of
                  participants for whom the same occupation
                  prime-target pairs were presented before the
                  close-associate pairs, but not in the group for whom
                  the two types of relationship were
                  intermixed. Associate priming was significant in
                  both groups. These results are attributed to
                  differing levels of processing of the primes,
                  invoked by participants' observation of the most
                  salient prime-target relationship.},

                  was examined in an experiment with standard
                  prime-probe method. The Arabic numerals consisting
                  of small numerals were used as stimuli with
                  global-local hierarchy. College Ss were tested. The
                  task was to name the target-numeral (global or
                  local) they attended to. The ignored feature of the
                  prime was repeated in the probe as the target and
                  had been transmitted to that level in the hierarchy
                  as the target of the prime. Negative priming
                  appeared only when the Ss attended to the global
                  feature; and no negative priming was found when they
                  attended to the local feature. In 2 compound numeral
                  conditions, 2 Arabic numerals were displayed in the

  abstract = {A longstanding idea in the literature on human
                  cooperation is that cooperation should be reinforced
                  when conditional cooperators are more likely to
                  interact. In the context of social networks, this
                  idea implies that cooperation should fare better in
                  highly clustered networks such as cliques than in
                  networks with low clustering such as random
                  networks. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a
                  series of web-based experiments, in which 24
                  individuals played a local public goods game
                  arranged on one of five network topologies that
                  varied between disconnected cliques and a random
                  regular graph. In contrast with previous theoretical
                  work, we found that network topology had no
                  significant effect on average contributions. This
                  result implies either that individuals are not
                  conditional cooperators, or else that cooperation
                  does not benefit from positive reinforcement between
                  connected neighbors. We then tested both of these
                  possibilities in two subsequent series of
                  experiments in which artificial seed players were
                  introduced, making either full or zero
                  contributions. First, we found that although players
                  did generally behave like conditional cooperators,
                  they were as likely to decrease their contributions
                  in response to low contributing neighbors as they
                  were to increase their contributions in response to
                  high contributing neighbors. Second, we found that
                  positive effects of cooperation were contagious only
                  to direct neighbors in the network. In total we
                  report on 113 human subjects experiments,
                  highlighting the speed, flexibility, and
                  cost-effectiveness of web-based experiments over
                  those conducted in physical labs.},

                  interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic
                  activities. We have compiled a data set consisting
                  of practically all actions of all players over a
                  period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000
                  people. This large-scale data set of a
                  socio-economic unit contains all social and economic
                  data from a single and coherent source. Players have
                  to generate a virtual income through economic
                  activities to 'survive' and are typically engaged in
                  a multitude of social activities offered within the
                  game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files
                  focuses on three types of social networks, and tests
                  a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In
                  particular we study the structure and dynamics of
                  friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find
                  striking differences in topological structure
                  between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie
                  networks. All networks confirm the recently observed
                  phenomenon of network densification. We propose two
                  approximate social laws in communication networks,
                  the first expressing betweenness centrality as the
                  inverse square of the overlap, the second relating
                  communication strength to the cube of the
                  overlap. These empirical laws provide strong
                  quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis
                  of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad
                  significance profiles validates well-established
                  assertions from social balance theory. We find
                  overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete
                  (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties,
                  and vice versa for networks of negative
                  ties. Empirical transition probabilities between
                  triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure
                  with extraordinarily high precision. For the first
                  time we provide empirical results for large-scale
                  networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible
                  we compare our findings with data from non-virtual
                  human groups and provide further evidence that
                  online game communities serve as a valid model for a
                  wide class of human societies. With this setup we
                  demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a
                  'socio-economic laboratory' which allows to operate
                  at levels of precision approaching those of the
                  natural sciences. All data used in this study is

  abstract = {The capacity to collect fingerprints of individuals
                  in online media has revolutionized the way
                  researchers explore human society. Social systems
                  can be seen as a nonlinear superposition of a
                  multitude of complex social networks, where nodes
                  represent individuals and links capture a variety of
                  different social relations. Much emphasis has been
                  put on the network topology of social interactions,
                  however, the multidimensional nature of these
                  interactions has largely been ignored, mostly
                  because of lack of data. Here, for the first time,
                  we analyze a complete, multirelational, large social
                  network of a society consisting of the 300,000 odd
                  players of a massive multiplayer online game. We
                  extract networks of six different types of
                  one-to-one interactions between the players. Three
                  of them carry a positive connotation (friendship,
                  communication, trade), three a negative (enmity,
                  armed aggression, punishment). We first analyze
                  these types of networks as separate entities and
                  find that negative interactions differ from positive
                  interactions by their lower reciprocity, weaker
                  clustering, and fatter-tail degree distribution. We
                  then explore how the interdependence of different
                  network types determines the organization of the
                  social system. In particular, we study correlations
                  and overlap between different types of links and
                  demonstrate the tendency of individuals to play
                  different roles in different networks. As a
                  demonstration of the power of the approach, we
                  present the first empirical large-scale verification
                  of the long-standing structural balance theory, by
                  focusing on the specific multiplex network of
                  friendship and enmity relations.},

                  of selective attention and delayed response. A low
                  dose (003 mg/kg) of scopolamine increased the rate
                  of forgetting in Delayed Non-Matching to Sample
                  (DNMS) but only slightly reduced the rate of
                  learning in a Concurrent Discrimination task. A
                  higher dose (008 mg/kg) decreased overall
                  performance while producing an acceleration of
                  reaction time (RT) required for a response. The
                  increased rate of forgetting associated with
                  scopolamine was preserved when performance was
                  measured as d rather than percent of correct and
                  when the rate of memory decay was assumed to be
                  exponential rather than linear.  A moderate dose of
                  nomifensine (08 mg/kg) reduced the rate of learning
                  a Concurrent Discrimination and had a small but
                  non-significant tendency to increase the rate of
                  forgetting in DNMS. Scopolamine was also found to
                  impaire selective attention in a manner that was not
                  consistent with poor inhibition. An increase in
                  negative priming was produced by both low and high
                  doses (003.008 mg/kg) of scopolamine. It was
                  concluded that scopolamine may produce an impairment
                  of memory directly in addition to it's effect on
                  selection or alternately, may produce an impairment
                  of selective attention only which is manifested as
                  impaired performance of a delayed response. The
                  administration of nomifensine did not produce any
                  significant effect on either interference or

                  non-phase-locked episodes of synchronization in the
                  gamma-band (30-60 Hz). One of their putative roles
                  in the visual modality is feature-binding. We tested
                  the stimulus specificity of high-frequency
                  oscillations in humans using three types of visual
                  stimuli: two coherent stimuli (a Kanizsa and a real
                  triangle) and a noncoherent stimulus ("no-triangle
                  stimulus"). The task of the subject was to count the
                  occurrences of a curved illusory triangle. A
                  time-frequency analysis of single-trial EEG data
                  recorded from eight human subjects was performed to
                  characterize phase-locked as well as
                  non-phase-locked high-frequency activities. We found
                  in early phase-locked 40 Hz component, maximal at
                  electrodes Cz-C4, which does not vary with
                  stimulation type. We describe a second 40 Hz
                  component, appearing around 280 msec, that is not
                  phase-locked to stimulus onset. This component is
                  stronger in response to a coherent triangle, whether
                  real or illusory: it could reflect, therefore, a
                  mechanism of feature binding based on high-frequency
                  synchronization.  Because both the illusory and the
                  real triangle are more target-like, it could also
                  correspond to an oscillatory mechanism for testing
                  the match between stimulus and target. At the same
                  latencies, the low-frequency evoked response
                  components phase-locked to stimulus onset behave
                  differently, suggesting that low- and high-frequency
                  activities have different functional roles.},

                  multiple sources of information, guided by abstract

                  situations, never directly experienced. Here, we

                  processing of an ignored object during selection of
                  an attended object in 3 experiments with 57 females
                  (aged 18-45 yrs). The level of internal
                  representation achieved for the ignored object and
                  the subsequent fate of this representation were
                  investigated. In Exp I, a prime display containing 2
                  superimposed objects was briefly presented; 1 sec
                  later, a probe display was presented containing an
                  object to be named. If the ignored object in the
                  prime display was the same as the subsequent probe,
                  naming latencies were impaired (negative priming),
                  which suggests that internal representations of the
                  ignored object may become associated with inhibition
                  during selection. Selection of a subsequent probe
                  object requiring these inhibited representations is
                  delayed. Exp II replicated the negative priming
                  effect with a shorter interstimulus interval. Exp
                  III examined the priming effects of both the ignored
                  and the selected objects.  Data show that for a
                  stimulus selected from the prime display, naming of
                  the same object in the probe display was
                  facilitated. When the same stimulus was ignored in
                  the prime display, however, naming of it in the
                  probe display was again impaired (negative
                  priming). Because negative priming was also
                  demonstrated with categorically related objects, it
                  is suggested that (1) ignored objects achieve
                  categorical levels of representation and (2) the
                  inhibition may be at this level.  (36 ref)},

                  many different forms (e.g. retinotopic-,
                  environment-, head- or shoulder-centred), but we
                  maintain that actions are represented in
                  action-centred space, meaning that, at the cellular
                  level, the direction of movement is defined by the
                  activity of cells. In reaching, for example, object
                  location is defined as the direction and distance
                  between the origin of the hand and the target. Most

                  task-relevant action can be evoked at any moment in

                  processes that accurately link vision and action
                  have had to evolve. Research is reviewed which

  abstract = {Notes that negative priming has traditionally been
                  viewed as a reflection of an inhibitory mechanism of
                  attention. However, recent accounts have suggested
                  that negative priming does not reflect inhibitory
                  mechanisms. Rather, slowed reaction times on
                  negative priming trials are either due to retrieval
                  of incompatible response tags or of mismatching
                  perceptual information, or due to extra processes
                  needed to distinguish past from present
                  information. In contrast, it is proposed that there
                  is no firm evidence to discount inhibition
                  models. In fact, although retrieval processes can be
                  implicated in negative priming effects,
                  understanding of these requires consideration of the
                  inhibitory processes involved in selecting

                  cultural evolution in humans. In this context,
                  successful strategies spread by imitation. It has
                  been shown that the details of strategy update rules
                  can have a crucial impact on evolutionary dynamics
                  in theoretical models and, for example, can
                  significantly alter the level of cooperation in
                  social dilemmas. What kind of strategy update rules
                  can describe imitation dynamics in humans? Here, we
                  present a way to measure such strategy update rules
                  in a behavioral experiment. We use a setting in
                  which individuals are virtually arranged on a
                  spatial lattice. This produces a large number of
                  different strategic situations from which we can

                  spontaneous strategy changes corresponding to
                  mutations or exploration behavior are more frequent
                  than assumed in many models. Our experimental
                  approach to measure properties of the update
                  mechanisms used in theoretical models will be useful

                  that when attention is diverted or overloaded,
                  features may be wrongly recombined, giving rise to ”
                  illusory conjunctions.” The present paper confirms
                  that illusory conjunctions are frequently
                  experienced among unattended stimuli varying in
                  color and shape, and that they occur also with size
                  and solidity (outlined versus filled-in

  abstract = {Understanding the neural basis of higher cognitive
                  functions, such as those involved in language,
                  requires a shift from mere localisation to an
                  analysis of network operation. A recent proposal
                  points at infinite recursion as the core of several
                  higher functions, and thus challenges cortical
                  network theorists to describe network behaviour that
                  could subserve infinite recursion. I propose here
                  that a capacity for infinite recursion may be
                  associated with the natural adaptive dynamics of
                  large semantic associative networks, once their
                  connectivity becomes sufficiently extensive to
                  support structured transition probabilities between
                  global network states. The crucial development
                  endowing a semantic system with a nonrandom dynamics
                  would thus be an increase in connectivity, perhaps
                  to be identified with the dramatic increase in spine
                  numbers recently observed in the basal dendrites of
                  pyramidal cells in Old World monkey and particularly

                  systems, that enables human beings to remember past
                  experiences. The notion of episodic memory was first
                  proposed some 30 years ago. At that time it was
                  defined in terms of materials and tasks. It was

  abstract = {The idea that inhibition is functionally important
                  for visual processing is not new. Research has
                  demonstrated inhibitory mechanisms in visual
                  attention through visual search, inhibition of
                  return, negative priming, novel pop-out, and visual
                  marking. Previous research in our lab has
                  demonstrated that previous knowledge about upcoming
                  flankers decreases the time to locate a central
                  target. This research has relied on a small set of
                  target and flanker combinations, which could be
                  grouped into a perceptual unit. If grouping occurs
                  positive priming could explain these effects with no
                  reliance on an inhibitory mechanism.  Experiment I
                  increased the number of target/flanker combinations
                  thereby, decreasing the probability of
                  grouping. Faster response times for correct target
                  identification were still found when participants
                  were provided cues to the upcoming flanker. Two
                  explanations could account for the results of
                  experiment 1. Activation of the flanker, which is
                  then ignored when the test display is presented, or
                  active suppression of the flanker items. Experiment
                  2 attempted to differentiate these two
                  possibilities. Both target and flanker cues were
                  provided with some probability. Expectations
                  regarding the cue validity were established based on
                  these probabilities, Presented cues conformed with
                  or violated these expectations. Results indicated
                  participants reliably used expected target cues to
                  facilitate target identification, but flanker cues
                  impaired target identification when target cues were
                  expected. Expected flanker cues did not facilitate
                  target identification, and target cues did not
                  facilitate target identification. An expectancy bias
                  was found for cues in which participant responded to
                  no cue expectancy as if it provided target cue
                  information. This may have diminished expected
                  effects in the expected flanker cue condition.  A
                  neural network model was provided. The model used
                  lateral and top-down inhibition to simulate flanker
                  incompatibility effects, negative priming, and the
                  current cued target and flanker experiments. The
                  model was successful in simulating target/flanker
                  compatibility effects, as well as offering a new
                  explanation of negative priming. The model also
                  simulated the effects of the current experiment, and
                  offered simulated effects of the cueing effect on
                  negative priming. Both the experiments and model
                  support an inhibition explanation of the cued
                  flanker effect. However, experimental bias and
                  possible asymmetry of inhibitory effects on flanker
                  suppression and target interference may constrain
                  the usefulness of these effects in practical terms.
                  However, they do provide convincing evidence of the
                  importance of inhibition in visual selective
                  attention.},

                  evidence, however, suggests that these regions are
                  not face-specific, but rather reflect
                  subordinate-level categorical processing underpinned
                  by perceptual expertise. Moreover, when people
                  possess expertise for a particular class of stimuli
                  (e.g., faces), subordinate-level identification is
                  thought to be an automatic process. To investigate
                  the neural substrates of person construal, we used
                  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
                  contrast brain activity while participants judged
                  faces at different levels of semantic specificity
                  (i.e., identity vs. occupation). The results

                  viewpoint that person construal is characterized by
                  the ability to access subordinate-level semantic
                  information about people, a capacity that is

                  functions of the referents of concepts. We claim (i)
                  that the distinctiveness of functional features

                  due to phase-resetting phenomena, to the emergence
                  of new oscillations related to the stimuli, or to a

                  from seven healthy subjects were studied by means of
                  time-frequency analysis.  The presence of new
                  oscillatory activities was evaluated by averaging
                  the energy of the single-trial time-frequency
                  transforms in the HFOs range (400-1000 Hz). To study

                  marked inter-trial coherence related to the HFOs was

                  combination of these three different approaches

                  thought.  Participants (23 males and 46 women) who
                  differed in self-concept valence (self-esteem) and
                  coherence (self-certainty, self-stability) engaged
                  in verbal self-reflection for several minutes, then
                  used a computer mouse to track the moment-to-moment
                  self-evaluation expressed in their recorded
                  narrative. Prior to self-reflection, participants
                  recalled positive or negative past actions (positive
                  versus negative priming), or did not recall past
                  actions (no priming). Priming affected overall

                  gradients to guide them towards the source of a
                  nutrient1. Such local cues pointing towards the
                  location of the source are not always available at
                  macroscopic scales because mixing in a flowing
                  medium breaks up regions of high concentration into
                  random and disconnected patches. Thus, animals
                  sensing odours in air or water detect them only
                  intermittently as patches sweep by on the wind or
                  currents2, 3, 4, 5, 6. A macroscopic searcher must
                  devise a strategy of movement based on sporadic cues
                  and partial information. Here we propose a search
                  algorithm, which we call 'infotaxis', designed to
                  work under such conditions. Any search process can
                  be thought of as acquisition of information on
                  source location; for infotaxis, information plays a
                  role similar to concentration in chemotaxis. The
                  infotaxis strategy locally maximizes the expected
                  rate of information gain. We demonstrate its
                  efficiency using a computational model of odour
                  plume propagation and experimental data on mixing
                  flows7. Infotactic trajectories feature 'zigzagging'
                  and 'casting' paths similar to those observed in the
                  flight of moths8. The proposed search algorithm is
                  relevant to the design of olfactory robots9, 10, 11,
                  but the general idea of infotaxis can be applied
                  more broadly in the context of searching with sparse
                  information.},

  abstract = {Examined the relationship between impulsivity and
                  lack of inhibition.  Inhibition was measured both by
                  the interference score and by the negative priming
                  effect in a Stroop color-word paradigm. The negative
                  priming effect in this paradigm is defined by slower
                  naming of a target color if this color was the
                  distractor in the immediately preceding trial. For
                  the study, a total of 210 Fifth Form school children
                  were selected. These were children rated high or low
                  by their teachers for either social or cognitive
                  impulsivity. A reduced negative priming effect
                  showed up with social type but not with cognitive
                  type impulsive children. No differences were found
                  regarding the Stroop interference score. The
                  divergence between negative priming and interference
                  as a measure of inhibition was discussed. Overall,
                  findings corroborate the distinction between a
                  cognitive and a social dimension of impulsivity.},

                  20 matched controls were given a version of the
                  Stroop colour-word interference task. Four
                  conditions were included: neutral (strings of
                  coloured Xs), congruent (colour and word matched),
                  Stroop interference (colour and word conflicted) and
                  ignored repeated (again, conflicting colour and
                  words, but colour on trial n matched the word on
                  trial n-1). Response times (RTs) to 30 trials in
                  each condition were measured to the nearest
                  second. Increased Stroop interference scores were
                  evident for the MS patients relative to the control
                  group. However, a negative priming effect was
                  evident for both MS and control groups; RTs were
                  longer for the ignored repeated condition relative
                  to the Stroop interference condition. This suggests
                  that both groups were able to inhibit distractors on
                  trial n-1, and that increased Stroop interference
                  scores for MS patients were not due to a complete
                  breakdown of inhibitory processing. Although
                  negative priming effects did not differ across the
                  groups, the possibility of a partial breakdown in
                  inhibitory processes could not be ruled out.},

                  whether face naming is vulnerable to semantic
                  competition in a similar way to object
                  naming. Previous experiments with object naming have
                  shown that a related prime picture presented 3
                  trials before a target picture results in an
                  increase in error rate and naming latencies when
                  compared to unrelated prime conditions. The
                  experiments here use the same paradigm, with errors
                  as the main dependent variable. In Experiment 1, the
                  prime and target faces were from the same
                  occupational category (e.g., politicians, actors),
                  and in Experiment 2, the primes and target faces
                  were also associated to each other. In Experiment 3,
                  the prime was presented as a name to be read
                  aloud. Unrelated filler stimuli intervened between
                  prime and target. In all experiments, there was a
                  reduction in target-naming errors in the related
                  conditions, and in Experiment 3 this was shown to be
                  largely a reduction in naming failures. The results
                  suggest that related name representations for famous
                  people are not activated in parallel and in
                  competition, and that there is some evidence for a
                  relatively long lasting facilitatory effect. These
                  results require some modification to any serial
                  account of face naming to differentiate it from the
                  generally well-established serial account of object
                  naming.},

  abstract = {In two experiments, we explored the effects of
                  co-occurrence and semantic relationships in the
                  associative priming of faces. In Experiment 1, pairs
                  of computer-generated human faces were presented
                  simultaneously (i.e., they co-occurred) with no
                  associated semantic information attached to them. A
                  significant facilitation effect in the subsequent
                  recognition of these paired faces (priming) was
                  observed. Thus, repeatedly presenting faces together
                  while keeping semantic information to a minimum
                  appears to be enough to produce associative
                  priming. In Experiment 2, the computer-generated
                  faces were associated with semantic information and
                  again presented ipairs. Priming effects arising from
                  co-occurrence and semantic relatedness were
                  observed. The results from these experiments show
                  that semantic relatedness is not the sole cause of
                  the association between faces; co-occurrence plays a
                  crucial role too. This conclusion has significant
                  implications for the current computational models of

                  pattern, common to all curves. Yet there is
                  variation both in amplitude and dynamics between
                  curves. Following some ideas of structural analysis

                  function from one curve to another to align the two
                  functions. For some models this method can identify
                  the true shift functions if the data are noise
                  free. Noisy data are smoothed by a nonparametric
                  function estimate such as a kernel estimate. It is
                  shown that the proposed estimator is asymptotically
                  normal and converges to the true shift function as
                  the sample size per subject goes to infinity. Some
                  simulation results are presented to illustrate the

  abstract = {More and more often, the outcome of a study is not a
                  random variable but a noisy function for each
                  experimental unit, resulting in a sample of
                  curves. Typically, the individual curves vary not
                  only in amplitude or intensity, but also with
                  respect to the time axis: different subjects
                  experience certain events sooner or later. Analyzing
                  such data involves finding out the time changes (or
                  curve registration) among curves. Following our
                  previous work where modified dynamic time warping is
                  applied to align two curves, we formulate a global
                  minimization problem to align all curves in a sample
                  and to compute the aligned average curve. Algorithms
                  for solving the minimization problem are presented
                  and tested with simulated and real data. The test
                  results are promising. The method, which involves
                  kernel smoothing of regression functions, estimates
                  the time changes and the average of the aligned
                  curves from noisy data. Large sample asymptotics is

                  yrs) (Exp1) and 24 college students (aged 18-22 yrs)
                  (Exp 2) in China. Exp 1 tested the influences of a
                  number of priming target(s) on negative priming in a
                  design of a number of priming target(s) (1, 2, 3, 4)
                  by the relationship of target of the probe and the
                  prime (nonrelated, distractor of the prime as target
                  of the probe). Exp 2 tested number of priming

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To align the repeated single trials of
                  the event-related potential (ERP) in order to get an
                  improved estimate of the ERP. METHODS: A new
                  implementation of the dynamic time warping is
                  applied to compute a warp-average of the single
                  trials. The trilinear modeling method is applied to
                  filter the single trials prior to
                  alignment. Alignment is based on normalized signals
                  and their estimated derivatives. These features
                  reduce the misalignment due to aligning the random
                  alpha waves, explaining amplitude differences in
                  latency differences, or the seemingly small
                  amplitudes of some components. RESULTS: Simulations
                  and applications to visually evoked potentials show
                  significant improvement over some commonly used
                  methods. CONCLUSIONS: The new implementation of the
                  dynamic time warping can be used to align the major
                  components (P1, N1, P2, N2, P3) of the repeated
                  single trials. The average of the aligned single
                  trials is an improved estimate of the ERP. This
                  could lead to more accurate results in subsequent
                  analysis.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have suggested, via the
                  interpretation of the negative priming effect as a
                  measure of cognitive inhibition, that schizotypal
                  subjects are less able to inhibit irrelevant
                  distracting information.  Recent research has
                  revealed, however, that negative priming effects can
                  be caused by two quite different processes:
                  distractor inhibition and perceptual
                  review. Therefore, unequivocal conclusions
                  concerning less efficient inhibition in schizotypal
                  individuals are not possible from previous
                  research. The present experiment minimised the
                  contribution of perceptual review to negative
                  priming. 29 Ss with high schizotypal traits and 28
                  Ss with low schizotypal traits were compared, using
                  a spatial negative priming task in which they were

                  circles presented on each display (S.  P. Tipper et
                  al, 1995). Results demonstrate that when a purer
                  measure of inhibition is taken, schizotypal subjects
                  are indeed less able to inhibit irrelevant

                  first (L1) (English) and second languages (L2)
                  (French). The tasks implemented were negative and
                  positive priming size selection tasks where
                  participants viewed two stimulus words that named
                  units of time (e.g., minute, day) and were asked to
                  press a button corresponding to the position of the
                  stimulus word expressing the longer unit of time. In
                  Experiment l, participants were tested in separate
                  blocks on positive and negative priming
                  trial-pairs. On a negative priming trial-pair,
                  participants had to respond to a target on a probe
                  trial that appeared as a distractor on the prime
                  trial immediately preceding. On a positive priming
                  trial-pair, participants had to respond to a target
                  on a probe trial that had been presented as a target
                  on the preceding prime trial. It was found that in
                  L1 but not L2 participants were significantly slower
                  to respond on negative priming trials than on
                  neutral trials, indicating evidence of inhibition in
                  L1 but not in L2. It was also found that in both L1
                  and L2, bilinguals exhibited significant positive
                  priming, indicating efficient facilitation of
                  relevant information in both languages.  The second
                  and third experiments investigated the time course
                  of negative and positive priming respectively in
                  relation to L1 and L2 reading. Participants were
                  tested at four different RSIs (response-to-stimulus

                  irrelevant information for longer periods of time in
                  L1 than in L2. Overall, the research implicates both

  abstract = {Fundamental to the theories of action-based
                  attention is the notion that response-producing
                  processes are automatically initiated when an object
                  receives attention. In support of action-based
                  theories, movement trajectories have been found to
                  deviate in the presence of non-target stimuli even
                  when the stimuli do not present a physical barrier
                  to the movement (Howard \& Tipper, 1997; Welsh,
                  Elliott, \& Weeks, 1999). A model of response
                  activation has been proposed to explain these
                  deviations. Predictions based on the model are that,
                  if a response is active at the moment of response
                  activation, then the response will contain
                  characteristics of both the target and non-target
                  response. If the non-target response is inhibited at
                  the time of response initiation, then the response
                  will contain characteristics that are opposite to
                  the non-target response. The five experiments
                  reported in this dissertation were designed to test
                  this model. In the first experiment, it was found
                  that the trajectories of the rapid-aiming movement
                  to a target location deviated towards the location
                  of a simultaneously presented non-target
                  stimulus. This finding replicated earlier work
                  (Welsh et al., 1999). The results of the second
                  experiment supported the hypothesis that movement
                  deviation away from the location of the non-target
                  stimulus was the result of inhibition of the
                  response to that stimulus. In the third experiment,
                  the target location was precued to examine the
                  effects of response priming on selective action.
                  Consistent with predictions, when the target
                  response was validly cued, no significant distractor
                  interference was observed. On the other hand, if the
                  distractor was presented at the cued location while
                  the target was presented elsewhere, then the
                  movement veered towards the location of the
                  distractor. A similar precuing methodology was
                  employed in the fourth experiment to explore the
                  effects that response priming and inhibition
                  associated with valid and invalid cues have on the
                  trajectory of the target movement when the target is
                  presented in isolation (without a simultaneously
                  presented non-target stimulus). The results of this
                  experiment were generally congruent with the model
                  of response activation. The final study was designed
                  to examine how inhibitory processes, hypothesized to
                  be associated with negative priming and inhibition
                  of return, would affect movement preparation and
                  execution. Consistent with previous work, the
                  presence of the distractor in the prime trials
                  caused deviations in the movement trajectories
                  towards the location of the non-target
                  stimulus. Inhibition of return and negative priming
                  effects, however, were not found.  Facilitation
                  effects associated with colour repetition and the
                  lack of competition in the probe trials were the
                  likely causes underlying these latter null
                  effects. Overall, the results of the present series
                  of studies suggest that the model of response
                  activation is able to predict deviations in the path
                  of aiming movements under competitive
                  conditions. Development of the model in terms of the
                  interaction between perception and action systems is
                  required to enable it to account for all effects
                  associated with selective attention.},

                  (i.e., the target is evaluated as positive or
                  negative) has often been interpreted in terms of a
                  spread of activation from the prime to affectively
                  congruent targets. In the present article, it is
                  argued that the effect might be due to a conflict
                  between the responses that are activated by the
                  prime and target, assuming that the prime serves as
                  a distractor for processing the target. This
                  hypothesis was confirmed in Exp 1 (N = 35) with a
                  sequential presentation of distractor and target and
                  further corroborated by Exp 2 (N = 72) with a

                  (via co-occurrence and/or shared semantic
                  information) versus purely categorical priming (via
                  shared occupational information). Participants
                  performed familiarity decisions for target faces,
                  which were preceded by sandwich-masked prime names
                  at either short (33 msec) or long (1033 msec)
                  SOAs. Although masking effectively prevented
                  explicit prime recognition, faster RTs were
                  generally observed for both associative and
                  categorical priming (relative to an unrelated
                  prime-target condition). At the short SOA, both
                  associatively and categorically primed targets
                  similarly elicited more positive going ERPs compared
                  with unrelated targets in the N400 time range (N400
                  priming effect), suggesting a common initial
                  mechanism mediating both forms of priming. By
                  contrast, at the long SOA, a typical N400 priming
                  effect was observed for associative priming only,
                  whereas the corresponding effect for categorical
                  priming was small and restricted to a left parietal
                  site. This hitherto unreported interaction of
                  relatedness, and SOA in the N400 suggests an initial
                  fast spreading of activation to a wide range of
                  related targets, which subsequently focuses to more
                  closely related people at longer SOAs. This ability
                  of ERPs to trace the neural dynamics of activation
                  for different forms of prime/target relatedness can
                  be exploited for testing different models of

                  performance on a later occasion. Roediger (e.g.,
                  1990) has provided a transfer appropriate processing
                  (TAP) account of this facilitation. By this account,
                  transfer depends on the type of task: some tasks
                  benefit from earlier perceptual processing, whereas
                  others require earlier conceptual processing.  An
                  earlier experience can also sometimes cause negative
                  transfer, as in negative priming experiments. In
                  this case, the effect is usually attributed to
                  temporary inhibition of a logogen-type
                  representation of the word (e.g., Tipper, 1985). In
                  the first series of experiments, long-term priming,
                  both positive and negative, are demonstrated within
                  a conceptual task. Neither account is prepared to
                  explain such effects.  Instead, I argue for a
                  component transfer account, in which the fundamental
                  principle determining transfer is the match of very
                  specific operations performed on earlier and later
                  occasions. The second set of experiments
                  investigates how recognition decisions are
                  influenced by speeded and slowed
                  performance. Recognition judgments have typically
                  been theorized to be the result of increased
                  specific familiarity of an item (i.e., fluency) or
                  through retrieval of encoding context. The present
                  studies demonstrate that nonfluent performance is
                  not necessarily detrimental for recognition.},

  abstract = {Recently, much research has focused on coping
                  efforts, typically emphasizing an effortful,
                  deliberate process engineered to help one recover
                  from life stressors. However, some coping, it seems,
                  occurs below the level of conscious awareness. Three
                  studies investigated the effects on unconscious
                  primes on mood, health, coping efficacy, and well
                  being. The first study investigated the priming
                  efficacy of six versions of the Scrambled Sentence
                  Task (Chartrand, 1998). Results indicated that three
                  conditions emerged, positive (success + health),
                  negative (failure + illness), and control
                  (affectively neutral). The second study examined how
                  the priming manipulation affected perceptions of
                  mood, health, coping efficacy, and well being after
                  an in-lab stressor, the delivery of a self-relevant
                  speech. Counter to hypotheses, a reversal of effects
                  obtained, such that participants' perception of
                  their own coping and well being decreased after
                  being exposed to the positive primes. After the
                  negative priming manipulation, perceptions improved
                  on these measures. The third study tested
                  alternative explanations for the unexpected findings
                  of the previous investigation.  Results suggested
                  that the reversal of effects was due to an
                  alteration of participants' relative standard of
                  comparison, rather than self-perceptions.  That is,
                  after the positive priming manipulation, the
                  "average other" seemed significantly better off,
                  making the self feel less good.  Results of these
                  studies are discussed in terms of implications for
                  the current methodologies used in the coping
                  literature and the role of the cognitive unconscious
                  in perceptions of global wellness status.},

                  neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by

                  visuospatial priming paradigm are not yet well
                  established. In the present study, we used a
                  visuospatial priming paradigm and event-related
                  functional MRI, to probe inhibitory and facilitatory
                  brain mechanisms in healthy adult women. When

                  neuropsychiatric disorders in which deficient

                  Huntington's disease (HD)). In study 1, the negative
                  priming effect, a response time slowing that occurs
                  during the selection of an action associated with a
                  previously ignored distractor, was enhanced in PD (n
                  = 25) and reduced in HD (n = 12) relative to healthy
                  control groups. In study 2, the flanker effect, a
                  response time slowing that occurs when an action to
                  a target stimulus is made in the presence of
                  distractors associated with a competing action, was
                  exaggerated in both PD (n = 18) and HD (n = 13)
                  relative to healthy control groups. However, the
                  slowing in PD was changed to larger response time
                  facilitation relative to healthy controls when the
                  correct action was associated with the distractors
                  and opposite to the target stimulus. Interesting
                  relationships between the altered negative priming
                  and flanker effects and clinical symptoms in PD
                  (e.g., bradykinesia) and HD (e.g., chorea) were
                  observed. The findings are considered within an
                  action selection model of basal ganglia function and
                  suggest that alterations in cognitive processes that
                  resolve the conflict between competing actions may
                  be a useful way to characterize some of the
                  cognitive and clinical sequelae associated with

  abstract = {Often in visual perception, the unit of selection
                  and representation is object-based. Examples include
                  selective attention, visual short-term memory
                  (VSTM), and effects like inhibition of return,
                  negative priming, repetition priming, repetition
                  blindness, and visual object tracking.  Disorders in
                  patients with visual neglect or Balint's syndrome
                  are also object-based. A weakness of many studies
                  reporting object-based effects is that the stimulus
                  objects did not contain any parts, unlike the real
                  world objects that our visual system has to analyze
                  constantly.  The goal of the present thesis,
                  therefore, is to characterize object-based
                  representation in VSTM when the stimuli include
                  objects with parts.  Chapter 1 laid the foundation
                  by showing that features are retained in VSTM in a
                  graded manner, and that features from different
                  dimensions are retained independently. Chapter 2
                  studied the encoding of color and shape features and
                  showed that object-based representation in VSTM is
                  modulated by the spatial relation of the features,
                  such that features are best retained if they are
                  from the same part of an object, less well retained
                  if they are from different parts of an object, and
                  least well retained if they are from two spatially
                  separated objects. Chapter 3 studied the encoding of
                  two features on the same dimension (2 colors or 2
                  orientations per object) in VSTM and found that
                  encoding does not benefit from being from the same
                  object: They are not retained any better than the
                  same features on two spatially separate
                  objects. Chapter 4 extended the findings of Chapter
                  2 to immediate perception in visual search
                  tasks. Together, these results showed th at
                  object-based representation in VSTM is modulated by
                  whether features are located on the same or
                  different parts of the object.  Some of the effects
                  found are not limited to VSTM, they are also found
                  in immediate perception. This thesis indicates that
                  many of the object-based effects reported in visual
                  perception will have to be revised when objects with
                  parts are included in the study.  (Copies available

                  priming effects at all stages of task performance?
                  In Exp 1, the authors varied the level of processing
                  factorially across 2 task stages--target selection
                  and response selection. Each stage required
                  perceptual (e.g., color) or conceptual (e.g.,
                  friendliness) processing of stimulus items (i.e.,
                  animal names). Negative priming was substantially
                  greater when deeper processing was required at the
                  target selection stage, but it was unaffected by the
                  level of processing at the response selection stage.
                  In contrast, positive priming was greater when
                  deeper processing was required at the response
                  selection stage, but it was unaffected by processing
                  at the target selection stage. In Exp 2, the authors
                  generalized this finding using a task in which
                  numeric targets were selected on the basis of their
                  parity. As in Exp 1, the deeper level of processing
                  at the target selection stage produced a larger
                  negative priming effect. These results illuminate
                  the role of target selection demands in modulating
                  the strength of negative priming. Ss in Exp 1 were
                  63 male and 81 female college students and Ss in Exp
                  2 were 22 male and 18 female college students.},

                  stimulus. According to a computational model of
                  inhibition, negative priming results from relative
                  activation between a target and a distractor in
                  probe trials. Thus, the degree of competition in the

                  hypothesis. Probe distractors grouped with a target

  abstract = {A schema approach to explaining processing of
                  distractors in selective attention tasks was
                  presented and was tested in three negative priming
                  experiments. It was proposed that the extent and
                  type of processing that a distractors receives
                  depends; in part, on information derived from the
                  instructions. The task was an intradisplay matching
                  task in which the prime distractors were presented
                  as probe targets for one-fourth of the trials;
                  response and response time were recorded.
                  Instruction was manipulated so that participants
                  either read instructions in which distractors were
                  defined and participants were told to ignore the
                  distractors (explicit instructions) or read
                  instructions that did not contain this information
                  (implicit instructions). Several other variables,
                  such as target position and stimulus salience, were
                  manipulated. The results generally were consistent
                  with the hypothesis that instruction (top-down
                  processing) and distractor salience (bottom-up
                  processing) would interact. When distractors were of
                  medium salience, explicit instructions produced
                  negative priming effects for two-thirds of the
                  participants, and implicit instructions produced
                  positive priming effects for two-thirds of the
                  participants. There was no difference in the number
                  of participants who showed a negative priming effect
                  and the number who showed a positive priming effect
                  when distractors were highly salient. Based on the
                  finding of an interaction of instruction and
                  distractor salience, it was proposed that the
                  mechanism responsible for negative priming may be
                  directed inhibition.},

                  examination of binding processes within and across
                  different modalities and domains. Recent studies of
                  feature-repetition effects have demonstrated
                  interactions between shape, color, and location in
                  the visual modality and between pitch, loudness, and
                  location in the auditory modality: repeating one
                  feature is beneficial if other features are also
                  repeated, but detrimental if not. These
                  partial-repetition costs suggest that co-occurring
                  features are spontaneously bound into temporary
                  event files. Here, we investigated whether these
                  observations can be extended to features from
                  different sensory modalities, combining visual and
                  auditory features in Experiment 1 and auditory and
                  tactile features in Experiment 2. The same types of
                  interactions, as for unimodal feature combinations,
                  were obtained including interactions between
                  stimulus and response features. However, the size of
                  the interactions varied with the particular
                  combination of features, suggesting that the
                  salience of features and the temporal overlap
                  between feature-code activations plays a mediating

                  intention is to explain the ideas that generate
                  frequentist methodology for model selection, for
                  example the Akaike information criterion, bootstrap

                  framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are

                  are available for the entire population of

                  population is observed. The problem of selection
                  bias, a hazard of which one needs to be aware in the

                  trial. We measured priming on trials that involved
                  either high or low cognitive control load, and found
                  that under high control load, negative priming was
                  eliminated, and could even be reversed to positive
                  priming, suggesting that the negative priming effect
                  depends on the availability of cognitive control
                  resources.},
